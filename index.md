1. Overview
1.1. Catalyst
This profile analyzes the political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental (PESTLE) structure in 
Spain. Each of the PESTLE factors is explored on four parameters: current strengths, current challenges, future 
prospects, and future risks.
1.2. Summary
1.2.1. Key findings
Spain performs well across governance indicators; however, Spain’s migrant crisis remains a 
cause for concern
According to the World Justice Project, Rule of Law Index (2022), Spain ranked 23rd out of 140 nations on the overall 
rule of law parameter. Spain ranked 15th on the fundamental rights parameter, 23rd on the criminal justice 
parameter, and 30th on the civil justice indicator. Spain ranked 23rd out of 140 countries on the absence of 
corruption parameter, which examines bribery or misappropriation of public funds or other resources with respect 
to government officials. The country ranked 26th out of 140 nations on the regulatory enforcement parameter. The 
regulatory enforcement parameter measures the extent to which regulations are fairly and effectively implemented 
as well as enforced, according to the index. Moreover, the country ranked 34th out of 140 countries on the order 
and security indicator. The order and security indicator measures how well a society ensures the security of persons 
and property.
According to data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Ministry of Interior, a 
total of 29,467 refugees and migrants arrived in Spain as of November 20, 2022. Of the total arrivals, 14,490 
refugees and migrants arrived in the Western Mediterranean, whereas 14,977 refugees and migrants arrived in the 
Canary Islands. As of October 2022, Spain exceeded 150,000 temporary protections for war refugees from Ukraine, 
eight months after the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine war. As of October 2022, according to the Ministry of 
Ministry of Home Affairs, Spain granted a total of 150,078 protections to Ukrainian refugees. The Valencian 
Community, Catalonia, Madrid, and Andalusia are the autonomous communities where most temporary protection 
has been processed and granted. Moreover, at the end of 2021, the country registered around 64,500 new asylum 
applications, according to the UNHCR. The influx of migrants represents a humanitarian and a political challenge for 
the current Spanish government.
The country is undertaking several measures to tackle the energy crisis, but a high level of 
debt burden is an area of concern
In October 2022, the Spanish government unveiled measures with an aim to help vulnerable households deal with
the energy crisis. The measures amount to EUR3.0 billion ($3.5 billion). These measures are expected to benefit 
about 1.7 million households. The government also stated that the social energy bonus would be reinforced by 
increasing the amount of energy eligible for a discount by 15%. In addition, a new category of electricity consumers 
(about 1.5 million households) would be eligible for a 40% discount on their energy bills. Moreover, the government 
also aims to create quarterly energy price increases which will remain in effect until the end of 2023. These

measures are expected to benefit vulnerable households. During the period from September 2021 to November
2022, the total energy stimulus provided by the Spanish government amounted to $38.5 billion (3.2% of GDP), 
according to economic thinktank, Bruegel.
Spain has a higher level of government debt compared to its European counterparts. The country’s general 
government debt stood at 118.6% of GDP in 2021, compared to 69.6% of GDP in Germany the same year, according 
to the IMF. According to the IMF, in 2022, Spain’s general government gross debt is forecast at 113.6% of GDP, while 
Germany’s general government gross debt is forecast at 71.1% of GDP. This high level of government debt is a threat 
to the country’s macroeconomic stability in the long-term. It increases the risk of amplified macroeconomic and 
asset price shocks. 
The country provides high social benefits to households; however, growing income 
inequality remains a challenge
According to the OECD, social benefits to households can be distinguished under two categories: social benefits 
other than social transfers in kind and social transfers in kind. The social benefits mainly entail benefits to 
households in cash, whereas social transfers in kind are related to the provision of goods and services, which mainly 
constitute healthcare and education. In 2021, Spain’s social benefits to households (in cash) amounted to 18.9% of 
GDP, higher than Norway (14.4% of GDP), Slovakia (15.2% of GDP) and Poland (16.0% of GDP). 
The Spanish economy grew rapidly after the country obtained EU membership. While per capita income increased, 
the distribution of income was unequal, highlighting class divisions. From the mid-1980s to the late 2000s, income 
disparities increased. According to Eurostat, Spain’s Gini coefficient (a measure of income inequality) stood at 33.0 in 
2021, higher than in the Netherlands (26.4) and Slovenia (23.0). A Gini coefficient score of zero corresponds to 
complete equality, while a score of 100 corresponds to complete inequality. Rising inequality creates political, social,
and economic challenges and stifles upward social mobility. Taxes and benefits need to be reformed and 
redistributive policies need to be framed to tackle high inequality. 
Spain exhibited a strong performance across various technological indicators, but poor 
performance on patents remains a cause of concern
According to the European Commission, Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) 2022, Spain ranked seventh out of 
27 EU member states. According to DESI, the country made significant progress in terms of integration of digital 
technology, human capital, and digital public services. According to Portulans Institute, University of Oxford, and 
Saїd Business School, Network Readiness Index (2022), Spain ranked 26th out of 130 nations. According to the WIPO,
Global Innovation Index (2022), Spain ranked 29th among 132 economies. In addition, the country ranked 28th 
among 48 nations in the high-income group category and ranked 18th among 39 economies within the European 
region. According to Speedtest, Speedtest Global Index (November 2022), Spain ranked 11th out of 180 economies 
on the fixed broadband indicator.
For many years, Spain has performed poorly in terms of registering patents. In 2021, the country registered only 
1,126 patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), significantly lower than the registered 
patents for various other major economies including Finland (1,392), Belgium (1,433), France (6,960), and Germany 
(17,971) during the same year. Spain’s share of tradable international patents also remained low, largely due to its
underspending towards research and development. The country's poor performance in this area has long been a 
concern to the government's science agencies. 
Although Spain has high ranking on index of economic freedom, the country’s high level of tax 
wedge is a cause of concern
According to the Heritage Foundation, Index of Economic Freedom (2022), Spain ranked 41st out of 184 economies, 
with a score of 68.2 out of 100 economies on the index of economic freedom parameter. Spain ranked 26th out of 
45 economies in the European region and its overall score is below the regional average but above the world

average. The country ranked high on several indicators including property rights, judicial effectiveness, business 
freedom, labor freedom, monetary freedom, and trade freedom.
According to the OECD, in 2021, Spain had one of the highest total tax wedges (ratio between the amount of tax paid 
by a single worker without children and the corresponding labor cost for the employer) among the OECD countries. 
Spain’s tax wedge, as of 2021, stood at 39.3%, compared to the OECD average of 34.6% during the same year. 
According to the OECD, Spain had the 16th highest tax wedge in 2021 among the 38 OECD member nations. High 
taxes on labor are likely to act as a deterrent to prospective skilled migrants who may wish to migrate to Spain. This 
can affect businesses by acting as a barrier to attracting talent to Spain’s labor pool. Since Spain is already facing the 
problem of an aging population and the reduction of its work force, a high tax wedge can aggravate the situation.
Spain performed well across several environmental parameters, but the loss of biodiversity 
and forest cover remain concerns
According to Yale University, Environmental Performance Index (EPI) (2022), Spain ranked 27th out of 180 countries. 
The EPI assesses countries on 11 core parameters. In terms of sanitation drinking water, the country’s rank was 15th
out of 180 countries, and it was ranked first in terms of sanitation. In terms of the overall biodiversity parameter, the 
country was ranked ninth out of 180 countries. In addition, out of 180 countries, Spain ranked 14th on wastewater 
treatment, 22nd on the air quality indicator, and 25th on the species protection index. The country’s strong 
performance in terms of the EPI 2022 reflects the government’s commitment to creating a sustainable environment. 
It ranked first out of 180 countries on various parameters including marine protected areas, and terrestrial biomes 
(national and global). 
According to Yale University, Environmental Performance Index (2022), the Biodiversity Habitat Index (BHI) is defined 
as an indicator which estimates the effects of habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation on the expected retention 
of terrestrial biodiversity. A score of 100 indicates that the country has not experienced any habitat loss or 
degradation, whereas a score of zero indicates completes habitat loss. According to the environmental performance 
index 2022, Spain ranked 163rd out of 180 nations on the BHI parameter, with a score of 32.8 out of 100. According 
to Global Forest Watch, in 2010, Spain had 6.0 Mha of natural forest, which stretches over 21% of its land area. In 
2021, the country lost 46.4kha of natural forest, which is equivalent to 19.9 Mt of CO2 emissions. Moreover, during 
2001–21, Spain lost 1.42 Mha of tree cover, equivalent to a 13% decrease in tree cover since 2000. According to Yale 
University, Environmental Performance Index (2022), Spain ranked 162nd out of 180 nations on the overall 
ecosystem services indicator and ranked 128th out of 180 nations on the tree cover loss parameter.

4. PESTLE Analysis 
4.1. Summary
In the November 2019 election, Pedro Sanchez’s party (PSOE) won the highest number of seats but failed to win a 
majority. Pedro Sánchez formed a government in January 2020, in coalition with Unidas Podemos. Spain’s
autonomous communities, such as Catalonia, are striving for independence from Spain, often fueling social unrest. In 
1959, the Basque terrorist group Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA) called for an end to the armed struggle for an 
independent Basque country, which was one of the major recent milestones in the Spanish political landscape.
According to MarketLine, Spain’s economy contracted by 10.8% in 2021, due to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. 
As per MarketLine, the economy grew by 5.1% in 2021. The economy grew by 4.4% in 2022, according to MarketLine 
estimates. In 2023, the economy is forecast to slow down due to the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war and the soaring 
levels of inflation. However, high level of unemployment and the country’s high level of government debt remain a
cause for concern.
The government has initiated both pension and labor market reforms which are likely to reduce the stress on social 
security funds. The country’s aging population and reducing work force are the biggest challenges Spain has to tackle 
in the future. Income inequality is high in Spain compared to other European counterparts. In addition, the 
government has embraced the Services Directive to modernize its business environment. It also aims to liberalize 
access to the product market and foster competition and mobility. Moreover, with an aim to deal with the soaring 
levels of inflation and energy crisis, the government implemented various measures for the same in 2022.
Spain has been slower to adopt technological advancements than other EU countries, although several policy 
measures have been undertaken. Spain was grouped with the moderate innovators in the Innovation Union 
Scoreboard for 2022, and its performance was below the EU28 average. According to the MarketLine, Spain’s R&D 
intensity, measured as total expenditure on R&D as a percentage of GDP, stood at around 1.4% in 2021, far below 
France (2.4%), Germany (3.2%), and Belgium (3.6%). Spain’s lack of innovation and entrepreneurship is because very 
few SMEs are involved in innovation, and the participation of the private sector and venture capitalists is low.
The regulatory regime in Spain has comprehensive and transparent laws to establish companies and carry out 
operations in Spanish territories. These laws are in line with the majority of other EU nations, making business 
operations smooth. However, the country has a high tax wedge. According to the OECD, in 2021, Spain had one of the 
highest total tax wedges (ratio between the amount of tax paid by a single worker without children and the 
corresponding labor cost for the employer) among the OECD countries. Spain’s tax wedge, as of 2021, stood at 39.3%, 
compared to the OECD average of 34.6% during the same year. High taxes on labor are likely to act as a deterrent to 
prospective skilled migrants who may wish to migrate to Spain.
EU membership has given the country an opportunity to undertake measures to meet the environmental and 
technological standards of its EU peers. Despite this, the country’s performance is below the EU average. A low level 
of R&D expenditure is the main challenge Spain faces in the technology and innovation landscape. The low level of 
environmental tax in Spain could lead to the over exploitation of natural resources. However, the increasing level of
energy production from renewable sources shows Spain’s commitment to improving its environmental landscape.

4.2. Political analysis
4.2.1. Overview
Spain has undergone a successful transition from monarchy to dictatorship to democracy. In October 2016, the leader 
of the Conservative Party and the former prime minister resumed office as the new prime minister, following two 
general elections and a series of political upheavals starting in December 2015. Mariano Rajoy was ousted as prime 
minister by a no-confidence vote led by the PSOE in 2018. In June 2018, Pedro Sanchez, the leader of the main 
opposition socialist party, was sworn in as Spain's prime minister after his predecessor, Mariano Rajoy, was 
ousted over a long-running corruption scandal. He has continued as acting prime minister since the 2019 Spanish 
general election, which was held on April 28. The incumbent Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s Spanish Socialist 
Workers' Party (PSOE) emerged as the largest party, with 123 out of 350 deputies elected to Congress. However, the 
Sanchez administration failed to form a government due to the lack of support from other political parties. After failed 
talks with other political parties, the country had another election on November 10, 2019, with much the same 
results, leaving the country without a proper government and a political deadlock. Following the weak results declared 
in November 2019, Pedro Sánchez agreed to form a government with the leader of the radical Unidas Podemas party, 
Pablo Iglesias, in January 2020. In August 2022, Spanish President Sánchez reiterated his message of support for 
Ukraine and called on Russia to withdraw from all territory of Ukraine.

4.2.2. Current strengths
Effective democratic system of governance 
Spain has been successful at making the transition from dictatorship to democracy. Since 1978, when the new 
constitution came into effect, democratic principles have taken firm root. The first years of democracy were 
dominated by the Spanish Social Workers’ Party (PSOE). Targets set under the Maastricht Treaty bind the Spanish 
government and do not allow it much room to diverge from EU practices. Therefore, the government’s economic 
policies, which aim to achieve fiscal consolidation, have continued. According to the World Bank, World Governance 
Indicators (2022), Spain had a strong percentile score of 80.2 in terms of voice and accountability, which measures the 
extent to which a country's citizens are able to participate in selecting their government, as well as freedom of 
expression, freedom of association, and freedom of the media. This indicates the effectiveness of the republican 
constitution.

Strong performance across several governance indicators
According to the World Justice Project, Rule of Law Index (2022), Spain ranked 23rd out of 140 nations on the overall 
rule of law parameter. Spain ranked 15th on the fundamental rights parameter, 23rd on the criminal justice 
parameter, and 30th on the civil justice indicator. Spain ranked 23rd out of 140 countries on the absence of corruption 
parameter, which examines bribery or misappropriation of public funds or other resources with respect to 
government officials. The country ranked 26th out of 140 nations on the regulatory enforcement parameter. The 
regulatory enforcement parameter measures the extent to which regulations are fairly and effectively implemented as 
well as enforced, according to the index. Moreover, the country ranked 34th out of 140 countries on the order and 
security indicator. The order and security indicator measures how well a society ensures the security of persons and 
property.
4.2.3. Current challenges
Spain’s migrant crisis
According to data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Ministry of Interior, a 
total of 29,467 refugees and migrants arrived in Spain as of November 20, 2022. Of the total arrivals, 14,490 refugees 
and migrants arrived in the Western Mediterranean, whereas 14,977 refugees and migrants arrived in the Canary 
Islands. As of October 2022, Spain exceeded 150,000 temporary protections for war refugees from Ukraine, eight 
months after the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine war. As of October 2022, according to the Ministry of Ministry of 
Home Affairs, Spain granted a total of 150,078 protections to Ukrainian refugees. The Valencian Community, 
Catalonia, Madrid, and Andalusia are the autonomous communities where most temporary protection has been 
processed and granted. Moreover, at the end of 2021, the country registered around 64,500 new asylum applications, 
according to the UNHCR. The influx of migrants represents a humanitarian and a political challenge for the current 
Spanish government.
Failure to meet defense spending
Spain is set to increase its defense spending over the next five years to reach $16.8 billion by 2027, according to 
GlobalData. However, according to GlobalData, the country will not meet NATO’s target of spending 2% of its GDP on 
defense. Spain’s percentage of GDP spent on defense will remain below 1.0% at 0.98% in 2027, up from 0.91% in 
2022. Moreover, the position of Spain on the international political stage, and its geographic location which is set 
away from the frontline in Eastern Europe, define the government response to the crisis, mainly because there is not 
the immediate threat of invasion felt by other European countries. Spain’s location on the Iberian Peninsula removes 
the threat posed by Russia to those with a closer geographic proximity to the conflict. Subsequently, any drastic 
budget increases as a response to the conflict may not materialize for the country.
4.2.4. Future prospects
Transforming Spain by 2050
In May 2021, Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez of the Socialist Party (PSOE) presented Spain 2050, a plan which 
aims to focus on improving key sectors, including education, health, pensions, employment, taxes and environment 
over the next three decades. Some of the main objectives include:
• Due to demographic changes, the number of students aged between three to 15 have reduced. The 
government therefore aims to increase its spending per student from EUR4,880 ($5,937.23) to EUR9,640 
($11,728.47) by 2050.
PESTLE Analysis
PESTLE Country Analysis Report: Spain ML00002-026/Published 01/2023

• A 20% increase in graduates with a degree higher than secondary school diploma. In addition, the 
government aims to bring down Spain’s school-dropout rates from 17% to 3% by 2050.
• Increasing healthcare spending from 5.7% of GDP to 7% of GDP over the next decade. Currently, Spain’s life 
expectancy stands at 83 years; by 2050, it is expected the life expectancy will reach 86 years. Due to the
increase in life expectancy, the government aims to bring about institutional changes to the current 
healthcare system.
• The government aims to increase the funding towards Spain’s caregiving system from 0.8% of GDP to 2.5% of 
GDP by 2050. The plan also envisions helping citizens to decide between care at home or at an outside facility 
or a mixture of both.
• Increasing tax revenues from 35% of GDP in 2019 to 37% of GDP by 2030, 40% by 2040 and 43% by 2050, 
would help reduce the seven point difference between Spain and the Eurozone. The government aims to 
increase taxes on alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, and petroleum-derived fuels, and introduce 
incentives that would encourage a greener economy.
• Digitalization of the public sector so that citizens can use the majority of the services online. In addition, the 
government aims to utilize artificial intelligence, which would be useful to analyze information, design 
policies, and evaluate services. Some of the applications where artificial intelligence would be used include 
real-time data on the evolution of the job market, the cost of medical procedures, and statistics on social 
services.
• With respect to employment, the government aims to increase the presence of under-represented groups in 
the workplace. In addition, the government aims to increase the number of women and young people in the 
current labor force and increase the integration of immigrants in the job market. Moreover, the government 
aims to reduce working hours from 37.7 hours per week to an average of 35 hours per week.
• The smaller regions of Spain should have access to services and technology.
4.2.5. Future risks
Catalonian crisis
Increased hostility toward the central government is a cause for concern. The CDC, a major party in the Convergence 
and Union (Convergència i Unió [CiU]) that governs the state of Catalonia, approved a motion regarding the political 
independence of Catalonia from Spain in March 2012. Since then, the call for Catalan’s independence has grown 
stronger, although it has been simmering since the economic crisis began in the early part of the decade. They 
contend that Catalans contribute a higher share to the central treasury than other regions of Spain and hence will be 
much better off economically by seceding from Spain. Another radical left party, the Catalan Republican Left, has long 
demanded a referendum on independence. In October 2014, the national constitutional court ruled that such a 
referendum would be illegal. In December 2016, Catalan’s foreign minister Raul Romeva alleged that the country’s
judiciary is being polarized politically to curb the Catalan government’s agenda to hold a referendum on the 
independence of the region from the rest of Spain, which was due in September 2017. People in the urban part of the 
state have shown their faith in the federal structure, but the separatist bloc is still adamant regarding its demands for 
a separate state.
In October 2017, the pro-independence leaders of Catalonia called for a referendum, which was considered illegal by 
the constitutional court of Spain. According to official sources, 90% of the voters wanted Catalonia to be a separate 
state and the separatist leaders in the Catalan parliament declared independence on October 27, 2017. The 
government dissolved the Catalan parliament using emergency powers and Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy triggered 
snap elections on December 21, 2017. The pro-independence parties won a majority of 70 seats out of 135 in 
parliament, but were unable to win the popular vote. In March 2018, thousands of separatists marched in the streets

of Barcelona, campaigning for a government in Catalonia that will work towards separation from Spain. The 
unresolved state of this issue is a big concern for the political stability of Spain. In September 2019, nine Catalonian 
separatists were arrested by Spanish police for planning an attack on the anniversary of the invalidation of the Catalan 
independence referendum by Spanish courts. The Catalonian crisis continues this year amid the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The separatists are now using the COVID-19 pandemic crisis as a motive to demand independence from Spain. A poll 
conducted between February 10, 2020, and March 9, 2020, by a Catalan government agency suggested that 47.1% of 
Catalans were against independence with 44.9% in favor. In 2021, the Spanish government pardoned nine Catalan 
independent leaders who were convicted over a failed independence bid in 2017. However, the Catalonian crisis 
continues, as thousands of Catalans marched in Barcelona in September 2021, calling for the region’s independence.
In September 2021, talks resumed between Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and Catalonia’s regional leader Pere 
Aragonès; however, both parties believed that their negotiations with respect to declaring the Catalonia region 
independent were “very far apart.”
In September 2022, Catalonia’s separatist leader stated that Catalonia would be pushing the Spanish government for a 
new agreement on holding a binding referendum on the region's potential independence that would be recognized by 
the international community and Spain. However, the Spanish government rejected the proposal. Both the 
governments aims to continue their talks in a bid to normalize the relations between Catalonia and Spain.

4.3. Economic analysis
4.3.1. Overview
Spain has been under pressure due to the country’s high deficit and public debt, although stringent austerity 
measures have been adopted to tackle the situation. The fragility of the government is also a big challenge for the 
economy. Sluggish labor productivity and utilization have put pressure on the country’s economic growth. The 
government needs to give more importance to labor mobility and an efficient progressive tax system to improve 
production growth. With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Spanish economy had been severely impacted. 
However, the economy recorded a growth rate 5.1% in 2021, due to ease in domestic mobility restrictions. In 2022, 
according to MarketLine estimates, the economy grew by 4.4%. However, in 2023, the Spanish economy is forecast to 
experience a slowdown and record a growth rate of 0.7% due to the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war, overall 
slowdown in the global economy, and high energy prices.

Well-developed infrastructure and a solid market
According to the World Economic Forum, Global Competitiveness Report (2019), Spain ranked seventh out of 141 
countries on the infrastructure parameter. The country ranked ninth out of 141 nations in terms of overall transport 
infrastructure and the efficiency of train services. Spain ranked eighth out of 141 countries in terms of airport

connectivity and ranked first in terms of road connectivity. Additionally, the country was ranked 15th out of 141 
nations in terms of market size, considering its overall GDP.
According to Invest in Spain, the country has two of Europe's busiest airports including Madrid and Barcelona along 
with 672 airlines connecting Spain with the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East. Moreover, Spain is a world leader 
with over 15,000 km in high-speed and conventional railways and is the second leading European country in container 
port moves, and home to three of Europe’s most important ports (Valencia, Barcelona and Algeciras). Additionally, the 
country includes the highest concentration of parks in the autonomous communities of Catalonia, Andalusia, Valencia 
and Madrid; however, in terms of size, the largest logistics platform in Europe is in the region of Aragon.
Low FDI regulatory restrictiveness index
The country is amongst the leading European nations in terms of regulatory openness to FDI. According to the OECD, 
FDI Restrictiveness Index (2020), Spain recorded an index score of 0.02. The OECD average for the same year was 0.06. 
A score of zero means complete openness, while a score of one means a completely closed economy. Of the 70 
nations covered in the OECD FDI regulatory restrictive index for 2020, Spain was ranked 12th. With a high level of 
openness and a favorable business environment, the country attracts high level of foreign investments which helps to 
sustain its economic growth momentum.

According to National Statistics Institute of Spain, the (estimated) inflation rate was recorded at 6.8% in November 
2022 compared to 7.3% recorded in October 2022. The high level of inflation was mainly due to an increase in 
electricity prices and prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages. High prices have led to tempered consumer 
spending at a time when the economy is re-opening. Moreover, prolonged COVID-19 pandemic has negatively 
affected consumer confidence with respect to the purchase of goods and services. Due to the Russian invasion of 
Ukraine, global oil prices have soared since the end of February 2022. The elevated price level is an impediment to 
economic growth. MarketLine also revised its 2022 inflation rate projections upward for Spain, from 4.2% in February 
2022 to 8.6% in December 2022.
High level of unemployment
A high level of unemployment is one of the major challenges the Spanish economy is currently facing. According to the 
OECD, unemployment in Spain was 12.6% in Q3 2022, compared to the OECD average of 4.9% the same period. This 
high level of unemployment reduces the overall income level, as well as demand and consumption expenditure, which 
in turn affects overall economic productivity. Additionally, countries such as Germany and the Netherlands had a 
lower unemployment rate. The unemployment rate in the Netherlands and Germany was 3.0% and 3.7%, respectively,
in Q3 2022. Spain recorded the highest level of unemployment rates among all OECD nations.

Economic recovery plan
In October 2020, the Spanish government unveiled a major plan for the economy, in order to reshape the economy 
and create 800,000 jobs over the next three years. The country plans to spend EUR140 billion ($162 billion) over the 
next three years. The aim of the plan is to have Spain transition to green energy and a digital economy. Additionally, 
the plan also aims to strengthen the public health service, improve public infrastructure, enhance energy efficiency, 
and develop professional training schemes. In 2021, the Spanish treasury launched a green bond program, aiming to 
provide guidance to public and private entities with respect to participation in the domestic market. The inaugural 
issuance of the program amounted to EUR5.0 billion ($6.1 billion) with a maturity of 20 years. The program was 
launched as part of a national sustainable finance plan that aims to encourage the financial sector to fight against 
climate change and promote the reorientation of capital flows towards a more sustainable economy.
In September 2020, the government announced a stimulus package of $84.9 billion to help the economy rebound 
from a resurgent coronavirus and aid fragile recovery. In February 2021, the government announced stimulus 
measures amounting to $13.3 billion towards companies in the tourism and hospitality sectors, small businesses and 
self-employed workers.
Government measures to tackle energy crisis 
In October 2022, the Spanish government unveiled measures with an aim to help vulnerable households to deal with 
the energy crisis. The measures amount to EUR3.0 billion ($3.5 billion). These measures are expected to benefit about 
1.7 million households. The government also stated that the social energy bonus would be reinforced by increasing 
the amount of energy eligible for a discount by 15%. In addition, a new category of electricity consumers (about 1.5 
million households) would be eligible for up to 40% discount on their energy bills. Moreover, the government also 
aims to create quarterly energy price increases which will remain in effect until the end of 2023. These measures are 
expected to benefit vulnerable households. From September 2021 to November 2022, the total energy stimulus 
provided by the Spanish government amounted to $38.5 billion (3.2% of GDP), according to economic thinktank 
Bruegel.
Spain pushes to become EU energy hub
Amid the energy crisis in Europe in 2022, Spain aims to become the new gateway for gas through an ambitious transPyrenees pipeline with an aim to improve its connectivity with the rest of Europe and open the way for Spain to 
become the European Union's new hub for green hydrogen. Spain has six liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals for 
converting deliveries made by sea into gas, making it the country with the biggest regasification capacity in the EU.
Such a pipeline could be a key conduit for exporting green hydrogen, an area in which Spain is already taking a lead.
Construction projects in Spain
The top five construction projects initiated in Spain during Q1 2022 include:
• Madrid Metro Expansion. The cost of the project is estimated to be $2.3 billion. The project involves the 
expansion of Metro Lines in Madrid. Construction work started in Q1 2022 and is expected to be completed 
in Q4 2027. The main objective of the project is to meet the growing demand for transportation and ease 
public transportation infrastructure in the region.
• Las Lomas del Higueron Residential Complex is expected to cost $696 million. The project’s aim is to meet the 
growing demand for luxurious apartments, along with leisure amenities in the region. The construction is 
expected to be completed by Q4 2025.
• Xerta-Senia Canal Development is estimated to cost $448 million. The main aim of the project is to irrigate 
across 11 municipalities of Baix Ebre and Montsià, Xerta, Aldover, Roquetes, Tortosa, Santa Bàrbara, 
Masdenverge, La Galera, Mas de Barberans, the Ebro to Castelló, Freginals, Ulldecona, Amposta, and La 
Sénia. The project is expected to be completed by Q4 2024.

• C43 Biofuel Production Plant is estimated to cost $223 million. The project’s aim is to utilize recycled raw 
materials and manufacture low-emission biofuels and reduce CO2 emissions by 900,000 tons per annum. The 
project is expected to be completed by Q2 2023.
• Monforte de Lemos to Lugo Railway Line Renovation is expected to cost $132 million. The project’s aim is to 
improve the quality and reliability of the railway connection between Monforte de Lemos and Lugo. The 
project is expected to be completed by Q4 2023.
4.3.5. Future risks
High level of government debt
Spain has a higher level of government debt compared to its European counterparts. The country’s general 
government debt stood at 118.6% of GDP in 2021, compared to 69.6% of GDP in Germany the same year, according to 
the IMF. According to the IMF, in 2022, Spain’s general government gross debt reached 113.6% of GDP, while 
Germany’s general government gross debt is forecast to reach 71.1% of GDP. As per the IMF, Spain’s general 
government gross debt is forecast to reach 112.1% of GDP in 2023. This high level of government debt is a threat to 
the country’s macroeconomic stability in the long-term. It increases the risk of amplified macroeconomic and asset 
price shocks. Moreover, with to the current energy crisis Spain faces and the government implementing various 
measures to tackle the soaring energy costs, the government finances are expected to come under pressure in the 
coming months.

4.4. Social analysis
4.4.1. Overview 
The economic growth achieved by Spain over the last two decades has had a positive impact on the nation's social 
landscape. The social issues in Spain are similar to those experienced by many other European nations, including the 
challenges of an aging population. The birth rate has been declining continuously, and there are fewer people entering 
the workforce. Pension reforms in the recent past have helped to improve the sustainability of pension funds. 
However, rising inequality could fuel social unrest. The current retirement age as of 2020 is 65 years; however, the 
government has plans to increase the retirement age to 67 by 2027.

4.4.2. Current strengths
Prudent social welfare measures
Despite being a late starter, Spain has made strong progress in terms of social welfare. The country’s social security 
framework is comparable to other EU nations. The nation's “Agreement for Improvement and Development of the 
Social Protection System” laid the foundation for social security reforms, particularly in terms of overhauling the 
pension system and encouraging people to work beyond the age of 65. Spain’s government spending on the social 
sector is higher than that of its peer group countries; it stood at 24.7% of GDP in 2019, compared to the OECD average 
of 20.0% in 2019. These measures have continued to deliver positive results for the welfare of Spanish society. 
According to the budget 2023, the government outlined a plan for a record spending amounting to $206 billion in 
2023, consequently leading to higher pensions and public worker salaries, as well as increased funding for higher 
education and health.

Social benefits to households
According to OECD, social benefits to households can be distinguished under two categories: social benefits other than 
social transfers in kind and social transfers in kind. The social benefits mainly entail benefits to households in cash,
whereas social transfers in kind are related to the provision of goods and services, which mainly constitute healthcare 
and education. In 2021, Spain’s social benefits to households (in cash) amounted to 18.9% of GDP higher as compared 
to other nations including Norway (14.4% of GDP), Slovakia (15.2% of GDP) and Poland (16% of GDP).

4.4.3. Current challenges
Aging population 
Spanish society faces the challenge of an aging population, which has not been balanced by a proportionate increase 
in the birth rate. The nation's birth rate has been declining continuously and fewer people are entering the workforce. 
Spain is facing the challenge of a disproportionate increase in the number of elderly people compared to the young 
population. The old-age dependency ratio (the number of people older than 65 years per 100 people of working age 
(20–64)) is also increasing because of increased life expectancy and a falling fertility rate. This will affect government 
finances, as the working age population’s contributions to support the non-working will decrease in the future. 
Although this is similar to the situation in all developed nations, the trend in Spain is among the steepest. This will lead 
to growing pressure on the social security system, which may become unsustainable as the number of contributors 
continues to decline. According to the OECD, the old age dependency ratio is forecast to reach 77.5 in 2050. According 
to MarketLine, the old-age dependency ratio in Spain was 30.2 in 2021.

High level of youth not in employment, education or training
Combined with a high inflation rate, a high level of youth not in employment, education or training, creates a serious 
challenge for Spain. Young people without education or training leads to the waste of human resources; eventually,
this will become a social burden for the economy. According to the OECD, Spain’s youth (15–29 years old) not in 
employment, education, or training as a percentage of the same age group stood at 19.4%, compared to the OECD 
average of 14.5% as of 2021.

4.4.4. Future prospects
Pension reform
In September 2020, the Spanish government declared there was an urgent need to reform the pension system. The 
government proposed a series of changes to incentivize people to continue working post the retirement age and to
make early retirement less attractive. The current retirement age as of 2020 is 65 years, however, the government has 
plans to increase the retirement age to 67 by 2027. Moreover, the worker will be able to access life-long monthly 
pensions, subject to the base amounts the worker paid towards social security during their working life, the number of 
years they contributed towards social security, and the type of retirement they are accessing. According to the latest 
OECD data available, in 2017, the Spanish government’s spending towards pensions amounts to 11% of GDP, higher 
than the global OECD average of 8%.
Spain’s recovery and resilience plan
In July 2021, the European Commission approved Spain’s recovery and resilience plan. The plan aims to implement 
reforms that will help the Spanish economy to become more sustainable, resilient, and better prepared for challenges 
and opportunities related to the digital and green transitions. Under the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), the EU 
will provide EUR69.5 billion ($82.2 billion) in grants to support the implementation of the reforms outlined in the 
country’s recovery and resilience plan. In June 2022, the grant allocation was revised upwards to EUR77.2 billion

($87.1 billion). All reforms and investments must be completed by August 2026. These are some of the main reforms 
under Spain’s recovery and resilience plan:
• The plan reinforces measures which encourage inclusive education systems to reduce early school leaving, 
skills acquisition in line with current and future labor market needs and improving the employment 
opportunities of the youth.
• The plan aims to develop individual pathways for counselling, reinforce the system of adult learning and 
modernize public employment services.
• The government will invest EUR2.1 billion ($2.5 billion) towards reskilling and upskilling measures, teachers 
training, digitalization, and internationalization of VET (Vocational Education and Training)
• Investments amounting to EUR3.5 billion ($4.1 billion) towards boosting Spain’s innovation capacity by 
financing research and innovation infrastructure and programs.
• Create 250,000 jobs.
• Increase Spain’s GDP by 1.8% to 2.5% by 2026.
.
4.4.5. Future risks
Growing income inequality
The Spanish economy grew rapidly after the country obtained EU membership. While per capita income increased, the 
distribution of income was unequal, highlighting class divisions. From the mid-1980s to the late 2000s, income 
disparities increased. According to Eurostat, Spain’s Gini coefficient (a measure of income inequality) stood at 33.0 in 
2021, compared to the Netherlands (26.4) and Slovenia (23.0). A Gini coefficient score of zero corresponds to 
complete equality, while a score of 100 corresponds to complete inequality. Rising inequality creates political, social,
and economic challenges and stifles upward social mobility. Taxes and benefits need to be reformed and redistributive 
policies need to be framed to tackle high inequality.

4.5. Technological analysis
4.5.1. Overview 
Spain has been slower to adopt technological advancements than other EU countries, although several policy 
measures have been undertaken. There is a need for a unified R&D policy across the various regions, as the autonomy 
of regional governments in matters related to R&D has led to the slackening of innovation. The increase in the number 
of authorities and the diversity of funding programs has increased the complexity of the innovation system. The level 
of coordination must improve if the desired results are to be achieved. A positive environment could be created by 
enhancing incentives and making the venture capitalist funding procedure simpler.

Strong performance across various technological indicators
According to the European Commission, Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) 2022, Spain ranked seventh out of 
27 EU member states. According to DESI, the country made significant progress in terms of integration of digital 
technology, human capital, and digital public services. According to Portulans Institute, University of Oxford, and Saїd 
Business School, Network Readiness Index (2022), Spain ranked 26th out of 130 nations. According to the WIPO,
Global Innovation Index (2022), Spain ranked 29th among 132 economies. In addition, the country ranked 28th among 
48 nations in the high-income group category and ranked 18th among 39 economies within the European region. 
According to Speedtest, Speedtest Global Index (November 2022), Spain ranked 11th out of 180 economies on the 
fixed broadband indicator.

Poor performance on patents
For many years, Spain has performed poorly in terms of registering patents. In 2021, the country registered only 1,126
patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), significantly lower than the registered patents 
for various other major economies including Finland (1,392), Belgium (1,433), France (6,960), and Germany (17,971)
during the same year. Spain’s share of tradable international patents also remained low, largely due to its
underspending towards research and development. The country's poor performance in this area has long been a 
concern to the government's science agencies. 
4.5.4. Future prospects
Government policies promoting R&D
The Spanish government has adopted several initiatives to promote R&D activities. It has undertaken measures to 
expand R&D infrastructure and improve the operations of all agencies involved in the system. According to 
MarketLine, Spain’s R&D intensity, measured as total expenditure on R&D as a percentage of GDP, stood at around 
1.4% in 2021. As part of an initiative, the Spanish government has set up an action plan for scientific institutions, as 
well as research and development in strategic business sectors, which is expected to cover 2021–24. In addition, in 
2021, the Spanish government set out its R&D spending plan for 2021–25. The government aims to invest EUR456 
million ($554.79 million) in the R&D spending plan.
Digital Spain 2025 Agenda
In June 2021, the president of Spain, Pedro Sánchez, presented the Digital Spain 2025 Agenda. The agenda aims to 
support the country’s digital transformation by guaranteeing digital connectivity, the roll out of 5G, increased cybersecurity capabilities, the digitalization of public administration services and companies including small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs), developing the data economy and artificial intelligence, and guaranteeing digital rights for 
citizens. Between 2021 and 2023, EUR20 billion ($24.3 billion) of public investments are expected to be spent on
digitalization. In addition, Spain’s general budget for 2021 has allocated EUR3.7 billion ($ 4.5 billion) for the 
implementation of the Digital Spain 2025 Agenda. Some of the main priorities of the agenda include:
i) Digital connectivity. Guaranteeing digital connectivity for the entire population, thereby eliminating the 
digital gap between rural and urban areas. The aim is to ensure the entire population has access to 100 
Mbps coverage by 2025.
ii) Continuing to lead the roll-out of 5G technology across Europe, thereby encouraging the contribution of 
5G technology towards enhancing economic productivity, social progress, and territorial structuring.
iii) Strengthening the digital skills of workers, with a special emphasis on the labor market, thereby bridging 
the digital divide in education. This objective aims to cover 80% of the total population with basic digital 
skills.
iv) Strengthening the capacity in cybersecurity, with an aim to have 20,000 specialists in cybersecurity, 
artificial intelligence, and data by 2025.
v) Promoting the digitalization of public administrations in key areas, including employment, justice and
social policies.
The Digital Spain 2025 Agenda includes other national digitalization plans: the Digitalization of SMEs Plan 2021–25, the 
Digitalization of the Public Authorities Plan, and the National Plan for Digital Skills.
Digital transition under Spain’s recovery and resilience plan
In July 2021, the European Commission approved Spain’s recovery and resilience plan (2021–26). Some of the key 
measures and investments of the digital transition include:
PESTLE Analysis
PESTLE Country Analysis Report: Spain ML00002-026/Published 01/2023

• The government aims to invest EUR3.6 billion ($4.3 billion) towards digital skills training.
• Investments amounting to EUR3.2 billion ($3.8 billion) towards digital transformation of the public 
administration, with a special focus on the justice, health care, employment, educational and social services 
systems.
• Investments amounting to EUR4.6 billion ($5.4 billion) with an aim to promote the digitalization of industry 
and small and medium enterprises, investments in artificial intelligence, digitalization of tourism and culture 
systems.
• Investments amounting to EUR4.0 billion ($4.7 billion) with an aim to support fixed and 5G connectivity, data 
infrastructure and the related ecosystem.
• Under the digital transition, the government aims to implement reforms across Digital Spain Agenda 2025, 
the 5G cybersecurity law, the artificial intelligence strategy, the digital skills plan.
Opportunities in the ICT sector
According to the International Trade Administration, the US multinationals in IT equipment and software hold a strong 
position in the Spanish market due to their long-term commitment and presence in the market. More than 70% of ICTrelated company headquarters are in two autonomous regions including Madrid and Catalonia. The number of ICT 
companies in Spain is estimated at 30,000, adding 3.2% to Spanish GDP as of July 2022. Digital transformation and 
cloud adoption is expected to drive investments across data centers in Spain. Major technology companies including 
AWS, IBM, Microsoft, Google, and Oracle announced their commitments in the last two years to open cloud 
computing centers in the country. According to the Spanish Association of Data Centers, the expected investment in 
developing data centers in Madrid is estimated to be $6.7 million. The planned investments are expected to offer 
opportunities to US-based SMEs active in cloud and AI solutions and services, as Spanish companies aim to adapt to 
digital transformation challenges within the next few years.
4.5.5. Future risks
Need to overhaul outmoded educational system 
Spain’s education system is centralized and rigid. Due to its inflexibility, the education system has not evolved to meet 
the requirements of emerging industries. There is a need to impart vocational education so that the labor force meets 
the changing needs of the economy. The education system is also inadequate to meet the needs of a knowledgebased economy. Spain therefore performs very poorly in terms of knowledge-intensive services exports and 
employment in knowledge-intensive activities. Tertiary education attainment among the working age population is 
lower compared to its peer group nations. According to the OECD, Spain’s population of 25–64-year-olds that had 
attained upper secondary education stood at 23.2% of the total population 2021, compared to the OECD average of 
40.6%.

4.6. Legal analysis
4.6.1. Overview 
Spain’s economic reform program has been coupled with regulatory changes to meet the challenges of the new 
economic landscape. The Spanish government has initiated numerous legal reforms to ensure integration with the 
EU. Tax rates have been reduced, investment regulations have been eased, and hitherto restricted sectors are being 
opened up to encourage private investment. The Spanish legal system is federal in nature; however, for jurisdictional 
purposes, the Spanish territory is divided into municipalities, judicial districts, provinces, and autonomous 
communities. Spain has performed well in terms of product market regulation. The autonomous communities have 
wide-ranging legislative and executive powers.

4.6.2. Current strengths
Legal framework comparable to other EU nations
Legal and regulatory aspects are crucial in order to create a successful business environment in any country. They 
reflect the policy framework and the governmental structure of that nation. The regulatory regime in Spain has 
comprehensive and transparent laws to establish companies and carry out operations in Spanish territories. These 
laws are in line with the majority of other EU nations, making business operations smooth. 
High ranking on the index of economic freedom
According to the Heritage Foundation, Index of Economic Freedom (2022), Spain ranked 41st out of 184 economies, 
with a score of 68.2 out of 100 economies on the index of economic freedom parameter. Spain ranked 26th out of 45 
economies in the European region and its overall score is below the regional average but above the world average. 
The country ranked high on several indicators including property rights, judicial effectiveness, business freedom,
labor freedom, monetary freedom, and trade freedom.

4.6.3. Current challenges
Starting a business takes too long
According to the World Bank, Doing Business Report (2022) report, it takes 12.5 days to start a business in Spain, 
compared to the OECD average of 9.2 days. It takes seven procedures to start a business in Spain, while the OECD 
average is 4.9. Starting a business still takes longer than the OECD average even after the administration introduced 
reforms in 2014, which introduced an electronic system connecting several public agencies, thus streamlining 
business registration. Over the years, Spain has undertaken measures to ease the country’s overall business 
environment. 
4.6.4. Future prospects
Easing product market regulations 
Spain has been improving its product market regulation. Product market indicators are a set of metrics that measure
the extent to which policies framed by the government promote or inhibit competition in areas of the product 
market where competition is possible. Many of the sectors are less regulated compared to their European 
counterparts. This is indicative of a more competition friendly market and fewer monopolies in various sectors. The 
government continues to ease product market regulation to increase competition. The government has partially 
opened up the telecom, energy, and transport sectors by selling off stakes in government-owned enterprises. The 
new competition commission is expected to have greater independence from political authorities, particularly in the 
case of mergers. Since the commission will be more accountable, the link between investigations and enforcement 
will be stronger. To increase competition in various sectors, a proposal is in place to set up sectoral regulatory 
bodies. The law on professional services is expected to ease access and foster competition and mobility in terms of
professional services. These steps will go a long way toward reducing market rigidities. According to the OECD,
Spain’s PMR score was 1.03, compared to the OCED average of 1.43. The PMR score ranges from 0= less regulated 
and 6= highly regulated
Labor reforms
The new labor law was adopted by parliament on February 3, 2022. It aimed to improve collective bargaining, adjust 
labor policy to changing economic realities, and restore the rights and power of employees that had been lost 
because of the 2012 reform. The reform will benefit precarious workers, like the cleaning staff at hotels in the 
tourism industry, as well as those employed in the construction industry and in agriculture, according to the Labour 
Ministry. The unjustified fixed term contracts have been abolished and permanent seasonal contracts were 
introduced for seasonal work. In September 2022, Spain approved a law with respect to improving working 
conditions and social security for domestic workers. The new law aims to guarantees domestic workers the right to 
health and safety protection equivalent to that of any other employed person. In addition, the new law abolishes the

Tax wedge higher than the OECD average
According to the OECD, in 2021, Spain had one of the highest total tax wedges (ratio between the amount of tax paid 
by a single worker without children and the corresponding labor cost for the employer) among the OECD countries. 
Spain’s tax wedge, as of 2021, stood at 39.3%, compared to the OECD average of 34.6% during the same year.
According to the OECD, Spain had the 16th highest tax wedge in 2021 among the 38 OECD member nations. Income 
tax and employer social security contributions account for 88% of the total tax wedge in Spain, compared to the 
OECD average of 76%.
Moreover, the tax wedge increased by 0.7 percentage points for the average single worker from 38.6% to 39.3%, 
between 2000 to 2021, according to the OECD. However, during the same period, the average tax wedge decreased 
by 1.6 percentage points from 36.2% to 34.6%, across the OECD. High taxes on labor are likely to act as a deterrent 
to prospective skilled migrants who may wish to migrate to Spain. This can affect businesses by acting as a barrier to 
attracting talent to Spain’s labor pool. Since Spain is already facing the problem of an aging population and the 
reduction of its work force, a high tax wedge can aggravate the situation.

4.7. Environmental analysis
4.7.1. Overview 
Spain was a late starter with regards to tackling environmental issues. The subject received government attention 
after Spain became a member of the EU. Following the establishment of the Ministry of Environment in 1996, the 
legislative process gained momentum. Spain has participated in a number of important environmental agreements 
and is committed to meeting its obligations, but its performance on environmental parameters falls behind other EU 
nations.

4.7.2. Current strengths
Commitment of national and regional governments
Both national and regional governments are responsible for the implementation of environmental regulations. 
Spain’s strong environmental policy framework has delivered results in the past, as environmental authorities at 
both levels are functioning according to EU directives. These authorities are focusing on environmental 
infrastructure investment and financing. They have also successfully managed to increase enforcement activities. 
Strong performance across several environmental indicators
According to Yale University, Environmental Performance Index (EPI) (2022), Spain ranked 27th out of 180 countries. 
The EPI assesses countries on 11 core parameters. In terms of sanitation drinking water, the country’s rank was 15th
out of 180 countries, and it was ranked first in terms of sanitation. In terms of the overall biodiversity parameter, the 
country was ranked ninth out of 180 countries. In addition, out of 180 countries, Spain ranked 14th on wastewater 
treatment, 22nd on the air quality indicator, and 25th on the species protection index. The country’s strong 
performance in terms of the EPI 2022 reflects the government’s commitment to creating a sustainable environment. 
It ranked first out of 180 countries on various parameters including marine protected areas, and terrestrial biomes 
(national and global).

4.7.3. Current challenges
Decentralized structure
The management of the country’s environmental framework is highly decentralized, which opens up gaps for further 
infringement. There are 17 different autonomous communities which function in various aspects, but no single body 
to take care of environmental regulations and implement them uniformly across regions. EU requirements have 
helped with the consolidation of environmental health, but the imposition of directives has been lagging.
Loss of biodiversity and forest cover
According to Yale University, Environmental Performance Index (2022), the Biodiversity Habitat Index (BHI) is defined 
as an indicator which estimates the effects of habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation on the expected retention 
of terrestrial biodiversity. A score of 100 indicates that the country has not experienced any habitat loss or 
degradation, whereas a score of zero indicates completes habitat loss. According to the environmental performance 
index 2022, Spain ranked 163rd out of 180 nations on the BHI parameter, with a score of 32.8 out of 100. According 
to Global Forest Watch, in 2010, Spain had 6.0 Mha of natural forest, which stretches over 21% of its land area. In 
2021, the country lost 46.4kha of natural forest, which is equivalent to 19.9 Mt of CO2 emissions. Moreover, during 
2001–21, Spain lost 1.42 Mha of tree cover, equivalent to a 13% decrease in tree cover since 2000.
According to Yale University, Environmental Performance Index (2022), Spain ranked 162nd out of 180 nations on the 
overall ecosystem services indicator and ranked 128th out of 180 nations on the tree cover loss parameter.
4.7.4. Future prospects
Green transition under Spain’s recovery and resilience plan
In July 2021, the European Commission approved Spain’s recovery and resilience plan (2021–26). Some of the key 
measures and investments of the green transition include:
• Investments amounting to EUR7.8 billion ($9.2 billion) towards energy efficiency of public and private 
buildings including new social housing.
• EUR13.2 billion ($15.6 billion) investments towards sustainable mobility in urban and long-distance, by 
improving railway infrastructure, creating low-emission zones in urban areas, financing green public buses, 
deploying electric charging stations, and developing urban public transport.
• The recovery and resilience plan aims to support the decarbonization of the energy sector by investing 
EUR6.1 billion ($7.2 billion) towards clean technologies and infrastructure and accelerate the development 
and use of renewables, including renewable hydrogen.
• The plan also aims to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change by preserving coastal spaces, 
ecosystems, and biodiversity and promotes the circular economy by improving water and waste 
management in the country.
Meeting energy needs through renewable energy
Spain has a strong dependence on renewable energy sources. The initiatives undertaken by the government include 
a combination of both regulatory and financial measures, and these developments are expected to help Spain meet 
its energy needs through sustainable means. Renewable energy’s share of final gross consumption has been 
increasing during the past few years. According to Eurostat, the consumption of renewable energy in terms of final 
energy consumption increased from 13.2% in 2011 to 21.2% in 2020.
In November 2020, Spain approved regulations to improve its renewable energy auction system and plans to replace 
the previous system from 2013. The new rules, if not complied with the generation permits, would expire. In the

country’s National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan, the government aims to install 50 GW of renewable 
generation by 2030. According to Red Eléctrica de España (REE), in 2021, renewables contributed 46.6% of the 
nation’s electricity with renewable sources compared to 44.0% renewables share in 2020 and 37.5% share in 2019.
Renewables share in Spain’s power production mix was recorded at 46.2% in April 2021. Spain aims to have 100% of 
its energy mix come from renewable energy by 2050.
Moreover, in July 2022, Iberdrola, Spanish multinational electric utility company based in Bilbao, Spain and the 
European Investment Bank (EIB) signed a new agreement with an aim to accelerate Spain’s energy transition by 
developing new renewable energy capacity. The Bank would provide EUR550 million ($650.6 million) green loans 
towards the construction of a portfolio of projects with a total capacity of around 1 800 megawatts (MW). The 
facilities will produce green and competitive energy equivalent to the average annual consumption of around 1.0
million households. The total investment in the wind farms would amount to more than EUR1.1 billion ($1.3 billion). 
Moreover, the European Investment Bank would finance solar photovoltaic plants and wind farms in several Spanish 
municipalities, including the rural areas of Castilla y León and Extremadura, which are considered cohesion regions 
by the European Union. The agreement would also contribute towards the European Union’s target of reaching 32% 
of energy from renewable sources in gross final energy consumption by 2030.

4.7.5. Future risks
Low environmental tax
Taxes imposed on environmental matters are lower in Spain. This could lead to the unsustainable exploitation of 
natural resources and a high level of pollution. According to the OECD, tax revenue from Spain’s environment tax 
stood at 1.8% of total tax revenue in 2020, compared to other peer nations including France (2.4%), Finland (2.7%), 
Denmark (3.2%), and Italy (3.1%). Authorities have to implement an effective environmental tax regime in order to 
prevent these environmental issues.

5. Political Landscape 
5.1. Summary
Spain’s transition from monarchy to democracy involved numerous political upheavals. After years of French and 
British rule, the nation passed into a dictatorial regime under General Francisco Franco. After Franco’s death, Spain 
embarked on the path to democracy, and a modern constitution based on the rule of law was established in 1978. 
The initial years of democracy were dominated by two distinct ideologies, those of the center-right People's Party, 
and those of the center-left PSOE. The PSOE received popular support in the early years of democracy, as it was seen 
as a viable alternative to the PP, the image of which was sullied because of its perceived closeness to Franco’s 
regime. 
After failing to win any of the first four elections, the PP emerged as the largest single party in the 1996 elections, 
allowing it to form a coalition government with several of the smaller regional parties. In 2000, leveraging strong 
economic growth, the PP returned to power with an absolute majority. Despite its economic successes, the PP’s twoterm Prime Minister José Maria Aznar saw his domestic popularity decline due to his support for the US’s Iraq policy. 
The PSOE came to power in the 2004 and 2008 elections under the leadership of José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, but 
lost the general elections in 2011 to the PP as voters held the PSOE responsible for the unsustainable deficit, high 
unemployment, and falling growth. The new government initiated economic reform policies and focused on the 
process of fiscal discipline. However, the high fiscal deficit put tremendous pressure on the government to 
undertake austerity measures, resulting in social unrest in many regions. The elections held in December 2015 
resulted in a political deadlock. Neither the PP (137) nor PSOE (85) were able to gain a clear majority
In October 2016, the leader of the Conservative Party and the former Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy resumed office 
as the new prime minister following two general elections and a series of political upheavals since the December 
2015 elections. He thus ended a period of political deadlock, unprecedented since the inception of democracy 40 
years ago. In June 2018, Pedro Sanchez, the leader of the main opposition Socialist party, was sworn in as Spain's 
prime minister after his predecessor Mariano Rajoy was ousted over a long-running corruption scandal. He has 
continued as acting prime minister since the 2019 Spanish general elections, which were held on April 28. Sanchez's 
Spanish Worker Socialist Party (PSOE) won 123 seats of Congress’s 350, while in the Senate it won 123 out of 266 
seats. After failed talks with parties to form a government in September 2019, the country held its fourth election in 
four years on November 10, 2019. The PSOE won the highest number of seats involved in the November 10 election,
but they failed to win a majority. The PSOE won 120 seats in Congress. On November 10, 2019, the next elections 
were held, in which the PSOE won the highest number of seats. Pedro Sánchez formed a government in January
2020 in coalition with Unidas Podemos. The next elections are expected to be held no later than December 10, 2023.
5.2. Evolution
5.2.1. Pre-1940 
Spain’s history has been dominated by the monarchial rule of several different dynasties. The country went through 
periods of varying strength and influence as its rulers changed. It was considered to be a glorious nation in the 16th 
century but lost that reputation in the 17th and 18th centuries as it came under the rule of the French Bourbon 
dynasty. Spain fought alongside France against Britain in the 18th century. However, the former allies became 
enemies in 1789 when Napoleon Bonaparte conquered Spain. In 1813, with British help, Spain was successful in 
Political Landscape

shaking French rule. In 1812, during the formation of the country's first republic, a national assembly in Cadiz drafted 
a liberal constitution; however, it was not adopted because of differences between various factions over rules of 
governance. A second Spanish republic with a modern, democratic, and secular constitution came to pass in 1931, 
but did not last long.
Spain remained neutral during both World Wars. However, the country witnessed severe fighting during 1936–39, as 
differences between right-wing and left-wing individuals over religion, land, and social reforms resulted in a civil war. 
The war was won by the right under the leadership of General Franco. He annulled most republican reforms and 
suppressed regionalism. He also established the supremacy of the Catholic Church. After Franco’s death, Spain came 
out of almost four decades of dictatorship in 1975. The new king, Juan Carlos I, ushered in a gradual transition to 
democracy.
5.2.2. 1976–2000
Spain adopted a new constitution in 1978, which established the country as a constitutional monarchy and granted 
limited autonomy to different regions. The PP's association with Franco’s rule sullied the party's reputation, all but 
assuring political success for the center-left PSOE in the early days of democracy. The PSOE came to power in 1982 
and won four consecutive general elections under the leadership of Felipe Gonzalez Marquez. The party followed a 
centrist policy, with traces of liberalism evident in terms of its economic and social policies. However, the party’s 
uninterrupted rule led to complacency, and its reputation was damaged by a series of corruption scandals that 
resulted in the Spanish population voting it out of power in 1996. In its place, the PP emerged as the single largest 
party, allowing it to form a coalition government with several of the smaller regional parties. In 2000, leveraging 
strong economic growth, the PP returned to power with an absolute majority under the leadership of José Maria 
Aznar. 
5.2.3. 2001–present
Prime Minister Aznar’s steady economic growth record won him admirers at home and abroad. However, his 
domestic popularity was affected following his decision to back the US-led attack on Iraq in 2003. Although the party 
had looked set to win a third term, the March 2004 Madrid terrorist attack confused the situation. The PP’s apparent 
attempts to shift suspicion surrounding the attack from Islamist groups to Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA) in order to 
deflect criticism of its decision to participate in the Iraq war backfired. As a result, the PP was defeated by a 5% 
margin. 
The newly elected socialist Prime Minister José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero quickly withdrew Spain’s 1,300 troops from 
Iraq. Overall, the country's foreign policy orientation changed, moving closer to that of two other European powers, 
France and Germany. There were no major shifts in economic policies, however, as economic growth continued 
during this period. The PSOE returned to power following the 2008 elections but fell short of an absolute majority by 
seven seats and was dependent on the support of at least one of the smaller regional parties in order to form a 
government. Between January and July 2010, the country assumed the EU presidency. In October 2011, the ETA 
renounced its armed struggle and called for a dialogue with the Spanish government. However, the separatist 
movement continues in Catalonia, a Spanish region. 
In the November 2011 general elections, the PP returned to power with an absolute majority against the backdrop of 
an unsustainable deficit, high unemployment and falling growth. In June 2014, Felipe VI became the King of Spain 
after his father, the former King Juan Carlos I, abdicated his throne. Around the same time, Catalonia’s wish to 
become independent from Spain became stronger, although the referendum to secede from Spain was declared 
unconstitutional in October 2014 by the constitutional court in Spain. Podemos emerged as a new force, after 
securing 69 seats in its very first election.

In October 2016, the leader of the Conservative Party and the former prime minister resumed his office as the new 
prime minister following two general elections and a series of political upheavals. He ended a period of political 
deadlock, unprecedented since the inception of democracy 40 years ago. But Pedro Sanchez from the PSOE party 
became the prime minister in June 2018 following the no-confidence motion against Mariano Rajoy. The country 
went for a snap election in April 2019 because Sanchez’s government lacked a majority. The election didn’t produce 
the desired results as the PSOE couldn’t secure a majority or the support of the other parties. The election in 
November 2019 also didn’t produce a majority, leaving the political landscape in Spain unsettled, with no clear route 
forward. Following the weak results declared in November 2019, Pedro Sánchez agreed to form a government with 
the leader of the radical Unidas Podemas party, Pablo Iglesias, in January 2020.

5.3.1. Key political figures
The key political figures in Spain are:
▪ Head of state King Felipe VI.
▪ Head of government Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.
Figure 15: Key political figures

5.3.2. Structure of government
Spain is a parliamentary monarchy, with a hereditary monarch and a bicameral parliament known as the General 
Courts (Cortes Generales). The executive branch comprises a council of ministers, which is presided over by the 
president, proposed by the monarch, and elected by parliament following legislative elections.
5.3.3. Structure of legislature
Spain’s parliament consists of two houses, the upper house is called the Senate and the lower house is called the 
Congress of Deputies. The total strength of the Senate is 265, out of which 208 members are elected directly and 57
members are appointed by the regional legislators. Each member is elected for a period of four years. The number of 
Political Landscape

seats in the Congress of Deputies is 350 and each member is elected by the proportional representative system for a 
period of four years. 
5.3.4. Key political parties
Three main parties dominate Spanish politics: the center-right PP, the center-left PSOE, Podemos and the much 
smaller Communist-led coalition, United Left (Izquierda Unida [IU]). Important regional parties include the left-wing 
Republican Left of Catalonia (Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya [ERC]), the center-right CiU, and the center-right 
Basque Nationalist Party.
The PP (People’s Party) is a center-right political party. The party evolved from the Popular Alliance, which was 
founded by Manuel Fraga, a minister during Franco’s regime. Indeed, the party’s closeness to Franco was the main 
reason for its loss of popular support during the first two decades of democracy. Furthermore, numerous internal 
divisions within the party had a negative effect.
The party adopted its current name in the 1989 elections, when it also elected a new leader, José Maria Aznar. Aznar 
was successful in transforming the PP into a cohesive party, which gathered strength in subsequent years and 
eventually came to power in 1996. Aznar worked towards the decentralization of power to the nation's regions and 
initiated economic reforms regarding liberalization and privatization. During his term, Spain became fully integrated 
with the various European institutions, and qualified for the European Monetary Union. 
The PP was voted back into power in the 2000 elections, with absolute majorities in both houses of parliament. 
During this period, Spain, along with the US and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies, participated 
in military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the former Yugoslavia. This move did not receive public support, 
particularly the deployment of the Spanish Armed Forces in Iraq. Aznar stepped down before the parliamentary 
elections in 2004, handing over control of the party to Mariano Rajoy. In the 2004 elections, which were held three 
days after a devastating bomb explosion in Madrid, the PP was ousted. The party was held responsible for growing 
Islamic militancy in the country, although the government held ETA responsible for the attack. The party also lost in 
the 2008 elections. The party had 66 seats in the Congress of Deputies after the April 2019 election and its position 
improved to 89 seats after the November 2019 election.
The PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party) is the oldest party in Spain, founded in 1879, and was the main 
opposition party following its defeat in the November 2011 elections. After the onset of democracy in Spain, the 
party came to power in 1982 under the leadership of Felipe Gonzalez and remained in power for most of the 1980s 
and 1990s. This uninterrupted rule made the party complacent, however, and it consequently lost popular support. 
A number of office bearers were linked to corruption scandals, which contributed to the party losing the 1996 
elections. In the 2000 elections, the party suffered a humiliating defeat, and consequently, José Luis Rodriguez 
Zapatero was elected as the new leader of the party. The PSOE went on to win the 2004 elections, although the 
victory was attributed to a wave of anti-PP sentiment following terrorist attacks in Madrid. Zapatero placed the issue 
of corruption at the top of his party's agenda and received enormous support from the Spanish people. The PSOE 
won the 2008 elections, with Zapatero securing his second term as prime minister.
The party’s economic measures are mostly liberal, although a few interventionist elements have gained support. In 
terms of foreign policy, the party has moved closer to the approaches taken by other European nations; there are 
also several ardent anti-American members within the party, and anti-clerical elements have surfaced in clashes with 
the Roman Catholic Church. In the April 2019 elections, the party secured 123 seats in the Congress of Deputies, but 
the party managed to secure only 120 seats in the November 2019 election.
Unidos Podemos, formed in March 2014, is a left-wing political party. The party was formed as a result of protest 
movements against inequality and corruption and is the second largest party after the PP in terms of membership. In 
the elections held in December 2015, it became the third largest party in parliament. The party wants to address the 
problems of inequality, corruption and unemployment that emerged after the European debt crisis. In the April 2019

election, Unidos Podemos secured 42 seats in the Congress of Deputies, but the number of seats reduced to 35 in 
the November 2019 election. 
Composition of the lower house of parliament
As of November 2019, out of a total of 350 seats, the POSE secured 120 deputies. The PP managed to win 89
deputies. The Unidos Podemos, Vox, ERC and others secured the rest.

5.3.5. Key policies
Economic and social 
In October 2022, Spain’s Finance Minister presented the 2023 budget draft before parliament. Spending in the 2023 
budget is expected to amount to EUR198 billion ($206 billion), mainly financed by the EU’s recovery fund. The 
following are the highlights of the 2023 budget:
• The government expects economic growth to be 2.1%, the budget deficit to narrow down to 3.9% of GDP
and the government gross debt to be at 115.2% of GDP.
• The government announced its aim to increase defence spending from 1% to 2% of GDP by 2029. The 
partial hike in defense spending would be allocated towards modernizing military equipment and
prioritizing Spanish organizations for contracts.
• The new budget would include a monthly check of EUR100 ($118.3) for mothers and children up to three 
years of age and an improvement in unemployment benefits.

• The 2023 budget aims to guarantee the purchasing power of pensioners and improve public employees’ 
working conditions and salaries. The government would reinforce investments in social policies including 
health, education, and subsidies for the most vulnerable.
• The government will extend free travel on commuter and medium-distance trains into 2023.
• The government plans to spend EUR274 billion ($324.1 billion) towards public welfare, the highest amount 
recorded in the country’s history.
• Beginning January 2023, the tax allowance for employment income would be increased to EUR15,000
($17,743) from EUR14,000 ($16,560).
• Beginning January 2023, the reduction in corporate tax would be reduced to 23% from 25% for small 
companies whose turnover is below EUR1.0 million ($1.2 million).
• The government aims to spend an additional 6.7% towards primary medical care and mental health.
• Under the budget for 2023 the spend on education would be EUR5.4 billion ($6.4 billion).
• Under the budget for 2023, the government announced spending of EUR4.0 billion ($4.7 billion) towards 
research and development.
Foreign 
Fiscal and financial difficulties have weakened Spain’s position in the EU, so it has been forced to adopt structural 
reform and austerity measures imposed by the EU. However, its standing in the EU has improved as its economy has 
recovered to register growth, unlike its Eurozone partners such as France and Italy. Since the formation of the EU, 
Spain has always had a positive opinion regarding the closer integration of the European nations and it has not 
changed its stance, even after it was forced to accept all the harsh austerity measures imposed by EU. In July 2020, 
India and Spain agreed to strengthen their bilateral economic cooperation regarding economic, business, cultural, 
scientific, educational and people-level cooperation. In November 2020, India and Spain signed a MoU to develop
scientific and technical collaborations in the field of astronomy.
In June 2021, Spain and South Korea signed a MoU to strengthen technological collaboration in the field of energy. In 
June 2021, Libya and Spain signed a MoU to encourage investment between both the nations and increase the 
volume of trade exchanges. In July 2021, ArcelorMittal signed a MoU with Spain, with investment amounting to 
EUR1.0 billion ($1.2 billion), to create decarbonization technologies at ArcelorMittal Asturias’ plant in Gijón, Spain. In 
July 2021, the UAE International Investors Council (UAEIIC) signed a MoU with the Spanish Confederation of 
Employers’ Organizations (CEOE). The MoU aims to enhance investments and promote bilateral dialogue between 
the UAE and Spain and attract foreign direct investments between the two nations.
In November 2021, Italy and Spain signed a MoU to increase cooperation in the naval and maritime fields. In 
November 2021, the UAE and Spain signed a MoU to develop an advanced technological framework. The MoU aims 
to increase collaboration in the fields of technological advancement and technology transfers. 
In February 2022, Dubai-based Emirates, and the Spanish tourism institute Turespaña signed a MoU with an aim to 
increase trade and tourism to Spain. In May 2022, Italian energy infrastructure group SNAM signed a MoU with 
Spain’s Enagás with respect to a feasibility study on the construction of an offshore gas pipeline between Spain and 
Italy in the Mediterranean Sea.
In October 2022, the Netherlands and Spain signed a MoU with respect to increase ties through bilateral 
consultations and close cooperation and support the social and economic development of the European region. In 
November 2022, South Korea and Spain agreed to increase bilateral cooperation between the two nations. In 
December 2022, Saudi Arabia signed a MoU with the Spanish state-owned Navantia company to build multi-mission 
combat ships for the Saudi Navy.
Defense
Spain’s defense policies have continued to focus on issues affecting international peace, security, and stability, as

and humanitarian operations within the framework of the United Nations Security Council, boosting common 
security and defense policy, active participation in NATO, reinforcing EU-NATO relations, contributing to increased 
security in the Mediterranean, maintaining close relations with the US and the Ibero-American Community of 
Nations, the promotion of peace, prosperity, and stability on the African continent, and the enhancement of defense 
diplomacy.
Under the budget 2023, defense spending would be increased by 25% to EUR12 billion ($14.2 billion) to help Spain
reach the NATO member goal of devoting 2% of GDP to national defense by 2029. The partial hike in defense 
spending would be allocated towards modernizing military equipment and prioritizing Spanish organizations for 
contracts. According to the Ministry of Defense, these schemes are expected to create 22,667 employment 
opportunities either directly or indirectly.
5.4. Performance 
5.4.1. Governance indicators
The World Bank report on governance uses voice and accountability, political stability and absence of violence, 
government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, and control of corruption as indicators for 214 countries 
and territories over 1996–2021 and beyond. The most recent study was carried out by Daniel Kaufmann of the 
Brookings Institution, Massimo Mastruzzi of the World Bank Institute, and Aart Kraay of the World Bank 
Development Economics Research Group. For any country, a percentile rank of zero corresponds to the lowest 
possible score and a percentile rank of 100 corresponds to the highest possible score. 
Spain had a score of 80.2 in terms of voice and accountability in 2021, which measures the extent to which a 
country's citizens are able to participate in selecting their government, as well as freedom of expression, freedom of 
association, and freedom of the media. Democratic principles in Spain have taken deep root since the adoption of 
the republican constitution in 1978. The country's elections are considered to be transparent, and there is respect 
for both freedom of expression and the media. Spain’s score is lower than Italy’s score of 85.0 during the same year.
Spain scored 64.6 in terms of political stability and absence of violence in 2021. Political stability and absence of 
violence measure perceptions of the likelihood that the government will be destabilized or overthrown by 
unconstitutional or violent means, including domestic violence and terrorism. Italy recorded a score of 64.2 the same 
year. 
On government effectiveness, Spain scored 78.8 in 2021. Government effectiveness measures the quality of public 
services, the quality of the civil service and the degree of its independence from political pressures, the quality of 
policy formulation and implementation, and the credibility of the government's commitment to such policies. Spain's 
score was higher than Italy’s 64.9 in the same year. Spain has a well-developed set of rules and regulations; the 
country has undertaken many legislative reforms in order to meet the objectives set by the EU, and the government 
is committed to fiscal discipline, pursuing economic policies that will ultimately lead to stability regarding policy 
formulation and implementation. 
Spain scored 74.0 on regulatory quality in 2021. Regulatory quality measures the ability of the government to 
formulate and implement sound policies and regulations that permit and promote private sector development. The 
Spanish government has initiated measures to liberalize and modernize its economy. By comparison, Italy scored 
69.7 in the same year. 
Spain ranked in the 78.8 percentile on rule of law in 2021. Rule of law measures the extent to which agents have 
confidence in and abide by the rules of society, and in particular the quality of contract enforcement, the police, and 
the courts, as well as the likelihood of crime and violence. Spain is yet to completely move away from the restricted

and bureaucratic regime that existed in its dictatorial past. Many other EU nations have transparency in governance 
that is still lacking in Spain at present. In terms of rule of law, Spain ranked higher than Italy, which ranked in the 
59.6 percentile.
Spain ranked in the 76.4 percentile on control of corruption in 2021. Control of corruption measures the extent to 
which elites and private interests exercise public power for private gain, including both petty and grand forms of 
corruption, as well as "capture" of the state. Although Spanish society is not completely free from corruption, it has 
proven to be one of the countries least affected by bribery out of those surveyed, according to anti-corruption 
organization Transparency International. Italy had a lower percentile score of 69.2.
5.5. Outlook
In the November 2019 election, Pedro Sanchez’s party (PSOE) won the highest number of seats but failed to win a 
majority. Pedro Sánchez formed a government in January 2020, in coalition with Unidas Podemos. The country has 
announced various measures it aims to undertake under the budget for 2023. Moreover, in the budget, the 
government has increased funding allocation across various sectors including healthcare, education, research and 
development and imposition of taxes on banks. The government has also undertaken various measures to deal with 
the soaring energy costs that the economy faces. However, the ongoing crisis in the Catalonian region remains a 
cause of concern.

6. Economic Landscape 
6.1. Summary
The economy is facing a high deficit and public debt, although stringent austerity measures have been undertaken to 
tackle them. The situation had been exacerbated by the banking crisis, which had too much exposure to toxic real 
estate assets; however, with the successful recapitalization of the banks, such risks have declined. Responding to the 
deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, the government has initiated aggressive labor market reforms to make the 
economy more competitive. In addition, the government has focused on consolidating the financial sector to clean 
up bank balance sheets and enhance transparency. After experiencing bouts of recession since the euro crisis, 
Spanish growth has rebounded, as the economy grew by 2.6% during 2014–19, according to MarketLine. According 
to MarketLine, Spain’s economy contracted by 10.8% in 2020, due to the outbreak of COVID-19, which resulted in 
the imposition of a domestic lockdown and international travel ban. In 2021, the economy recorded a growth rate of 
5.1% due to the removal of lockdown restrictions. According to MarketLine estimates, in 2022, the economy
recorded a growth rate of 4.5% as the country continued to recover from the pandemic. According to MarketLine the
economy is forecast to grow by 0.4% in 2023, due to sharp rise in global food and energy prices and overall 
slowdown in the global economy.
6.2. Evolution
6.2.1. 1940–75
During the late 1930s, when Spain was under the dictatorial regime of Franco, the country's economy was in a state 
of decline. After the civil war, the country was faced with formidable economic challenges. It did not retain any gold 
or foreign exchange reserves, which would have enabled it to meet demand through imports, and the production 
capacity of both agriculture and industry had bottomed out. Because of the country's global isolation, its autocratic 
regime resorted to economic self-sufficiency. During World War II, expenditure on foreign arms shot up, adding 
further pressure on the economy. The 1940s saw a decade of negative growth, and by the early 1950s, per capita 
GDP was around 40% of the average of Western European nations. After years of economic stagnation, coupled with 
the tripling of prices amid the growth of a black market during 1940–50, gradual improvements started in the mid1950s. The dictum of self-sufficiency was slowly abandoned, and agricultural and industrial production picked up. 
The economy received a boost in 1953 after the Pact of Madrid was signed between Spain and the US. The Franco 
government permitted the establishment of US military bases on Spanish soil; in return, the US government 
provided substantial economic aid to Spain. More than $1.0 billion of economic aid was provided to the country 
during 1953–58. 
In the following years, economic growth continued, and piecemeal reform measures were initiated. However, an 
inefficient bureaucracy restricted the implementation of these reforms. The economy faced a crisis in the late 1950s 
as domestic demand outstripped supply, leading to a rise in inflationary pressure and declining exports and foreign 
exchange reserves. 
In 1959, Spain launched its economic stabilization plan. The objectives of the plan were to take the necessary fiscal 
and monetary measures to restrict demand and contain inflation. It also aimed to liberalize foreign trade and

encourage foreign investment. Consequently, the 1960s and 1970s saw buoyancy in the economy, as a large amount 
of foreign investment flowed in. The country experienced an economic boom between 1961 and 1973, with the 
economy growing 7.3% annually. In addition, the booming tourism and automotive sectors boosted the economy 
and fueled the development of the supply and services sectors. The country witnessed fast economic growth until it 
was hit by the 1973 oil crisis, which resulted in an economic slowdown. 
6.2.2. 1976–2021
In the initial years of democracy, the focus of policymakers was on achieving a smooth transition from dictatorship to 
democracy, and economic policies took a back seat. As a result, the economy failed to adjust to the changing 
economic environment that came into existence after the oil price shocks. The level of wages increased during 1974–
76, and there was a rise in unemployment while the government budget deficit swelled. A recession began in 1975, 
and the Spanish economy was found to be more vulnerable than most other modern economies due to structural 
deficiencies.
When the socialist government took office in late 1982, inflation was running as high as 14.4% and public spending 
was out of control. The government initiated severe austerity measures in order to rejuvenate the economy. There 
was a marginal improvement in the early 1980s, but the growth process did not truly gather momentum until after 
the mid-1980s, when an increase in demand was accompanied by growing industrial output. 
Spain’s accession to the EU in 1986 required the country to further liberalize its economy and undertake economic 
reform measures in order to conform to EU guidelines. Following peak growth years in the late 1980s, a global 
economic slowdown triggered an economic recession in 1992. Spain's economy partially recovered during the first 
Aznar administration (1996–2000), driven by greater consumer confidence and increased private consumption. The 
economy continued to grow over the following years, albeit at a slower rate. The economy grew by an average of 
3.2% during 1993–2007. However, in 2008, the global meltdown caused Spanish economic growth to subside to 
0.9%. The country was in recession in 2009, and its economy contracted by 3.8%. However, GDP registered a 
marginal increase of 0.2% in 2010, only to slip again into recession in 2011 and 2012, with the economy contracting 
by 0.8% and 3.0%, respectively. Spain remained in recession in 2013, with the economy contracting by 1.4%. During 
2014–18, the economy grew by 2.7%. According to MarketLine, GDP grew by 2.0% in 2019, due to stable consumer 
spending and investments. In 2020, due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy contracted by 
10.8%, according to MarketLine. In 2021, due to removal of restrictions on domestic ability, the economy recorded a 
growth rate of 5.1%. According to MarketLine estimates, the economy recorded a growth rate of 4.5% in 2022.

6.3. Structure and policies 
6.3.1. Financial system
Overview
Spain is a member of the EU and has thus relinquished control of its monetary policy authority to the ECB. The Bank 
of Spain (Banco de Espana) is the country's central bank and is responsible for the implementation of monetary 
policy. Spain began the deregulation of its financial system in the 1990s after becoming a member of the EU. The 
central bank is responsible for ensuring the smooth operation and stability of the Spanish financial system.
Financial authorities and regulators
Banco de Espana is responsible for the implementation of monetary policy and follows the directives of the ECB. It is 
also the main supervisory agency for the quality of commercial bank portfolios and the protection of the monetary 
system against bank failures. To comply with the requirements of the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, the bank was required 
to become independent from the government and has consequently enforced strict limits on government use of the 
money supply as a source of loans. 
Economic Landscape
PESTLE Country Analysis Report: Spain ML00002-021/Published 01/2023

Banco de Espana is responsible for defining and implementing the EU’s monetary policy, with the principal aim of 
maintaining price stability across the Eurozone. The bank is also responsible for the sound working of the country’s 
payment systems. 
The Comision Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV) is the agency in charge of supervising and inspecting the 
Spanish stock markets and the activities of the participants in those markets. It was created by the Securities 
Markets Law, which initiated stock market reforms. The scope of the commission includes all companies that issue 
securities. The commission also supervises entities such as brokers and dealers engaged in the purchase and sale of 
securities. Portfolio management companies focusing primarily on individuals' assets are also subject to CNMV 
supervision.
6.4. Performance 
6.4.1. GDP and growth rate
Since the mid-1990s, Spanish economic growth has largely outperformed the rest of the Eurozone, primarily driven 
by tourism and European subsidies. The economy grew at an average rate of 4.5% during 1997–2000. The country’s 
growth slowed somewhat during 2001–03 and averaged 3.2%; the economy registered an average growth rate of 
3.7% during 2000–07. After recording steady growth during 2000–07, the Spanish economy started to decline in 
2008, recording growth of 0.9%. The deceleration in 2008 came about as a result of the sharp slowdown in national 
demand, while real estate market prices also showed signs of weakening. Moreover, weak consumption and 
investment expenditure also affected growth, as household wealth was eroded due to the crash in housing prices. 
The downward trend continued in 2009, and the economy contracted by 3.8%. In 2010, the economy grew by just 
0.2%, and again slipped into recession, which continued during 2012 and 2013, according to MarketLine. In 2014 and 
2015, the country posted modest growth of 1.4% and 3.8%, respectively. The country grew by 3% in 2016 and 2017. 
According to MarketLine, the economy grew by 2.4% in 2018 and by 2.0% in 2019. The marginal slowdown in the 
economy in recent years is due to the adverse impact of the global economic slowdown, which affected household 
consumption and investments. According to MarketLine, the economy contracted by 10.8% due to the outbreak of 
COVID-19. According to MarketLine, the economy grew by 5.1% in 2021. The economy recorded a growth rate of
4.5% in 2022, as the services and industrial sector continued to recover. However, in 2023, the economy is forecast 
to experience a slowdown and record a growth rate of 0.7% due to the energy crisis, the impact of the RussiaUkraine war, the soaring levels of inflation, tight financial conditions, and an overall slowdown in the global 
economy.

6.4.2. GDP composition by sector
The services sector is the major contributor to the economy. According to MarketLine estimates, the services sector 
share of GDP stood at 74.3% in 2022. It is also the fastest growing sector, followed by manufacturing and agriculture. 
In 2022, the industrial sector contributed 22.7% of GDP and agriculture contributed the remaining 3.0%.

Agriculture
Agriculture was a dominant sector of the Spanish economy up until 1945; however, its significance gradually 
declined in the aftermath of industrialization. During the 1950s, there was large-scale migration to cities as food 
prices increased rapidly and the surplus labor pool began to shrink. With increasing industrialization, the share of 
agriculture declined. 
The fruits and vegetables segment is a significant segment in the agriculture sector and it generates around one 
quarter of the sector's revenue. In the northwest of the country, cereals, potatoes, and sugar beets are important 
products. Agricultural production in Spain has been declining, and one of the major concerns has been the 
abandonment of farms by farmers. According to MarketLine estimates, agriculture growth was 4.3% in 2022 and the 
sector is forecast to grow by 2.8% in 2023.

Industry
Initially, the focus of industry was on the production of goods for domestic consumption and on intermediate 
products linked to infrastructure and construction services, but gradually the sector became broad-based, with the 
inclusion of capital goods and goods for export. According to MarketLine estimates, industrial growth recorded a 
growth 6.4% in 2022. The industrial sector is forecast to grow by 4.1% in 2023.

Services 
In the services sector, retailing, tourism, banking, and telecommunications are the most important contributors. The 
tourism sector is the largest foreign exchange revenue earner for the Spanish economy. According to MarketLine 
estimates, the sector recorded a growth of 6.4% in 2022 and is forecast to grow by 4.1% in 2023.

According to the IMF, the current account surplus was recorded at 0.9% in 2021. The current account deficit is 
forecast at 0.2% of GDP in 2022.
6.4.5. Exports and imports
According to the IMF, goods and services’ import and export volumes growth were 13.9% and 14.7%, respectively, in 
2021. In 2022, goods and services’ import and export volumes are forecast to grow by 8.6% and 12.1%, respectively.
According to the UN Comtrade Database, Spain’s major export partners in 2021 were France (15.2%), Germany 
(9.8%), Italy (8.0%), Portugal (7.5%), and the UK (5.5%). Spain’s major import partners in 2021 were Germany 
(10.6%), China (9.7%), France (9.5%), Italy (6.3%), and the US (4.7%).

6.4.7. International investment position
Foreign direct investments (FDI)
According to Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism, in 2021, the country received a total of EUR28.8 billion ($34.1 
billion) of foreign direct investments, an increase of 17.7% compared to the previous year. During the period January 
to December 2021, in cumulative terms, the Community of Madrid attracted the greatest volume of investment, at 
EUR20.9 billion ($24.7 billion) an increase of 14.5% as compared to the previous year.
The sector that attracted the highest foreign investment in 2021 was supply of electrical, energy, gas, steam, and air, 
followed by specialized construction activities, programming, consulting, and related activities, and retail trade 
except motor vehicles.
As for the country of the origin of investment, Luxembourg recorded the highest investments in Spain at EUR8.7 
billion ($10.3 billion), followed by France (EUR6.7 billion ($7.9 billion)), the Netherlands (EUR3.0 billion ($3.5 billion)), 
the UK (EUR2.5billion ($3.0 billion)), the US (EUR1.6 billion ($1.9 billion)), and Germany (EUR1.0 billion ($1.2 billion)).
Inflation
According to MarketLine estimates, inflation was recorded at 8.6% in 2022, due to the impact of the Russia-Ukraine 
war which has resulted in a major energy crisis among European economies. According to National Statistics Institute 
(INE), the inflation rate in November 2022 was 6.8% compared to 7.3% in October 2022. Over the month, consumer 
prices fell by 0.1%. According to MarketLine, the inflation rate is forecast to be at 4.1% in 2023, mainly due to the 
various government measures introduced to fight inflation and high energy costs.

Employment
The Spanish economy is suffering from high levels of unemployment and has for quite some time. According to 
MarketLine estimates, the unemployment rate was recorded at 13.4% in 2022. The unemployment rate is forecast to 
decrease to 13% in 2023.
According to National Statistics Institute of Spain, the country’s unemployment rate increased to 12.7% in Q3 2022 
compared to 12.5% recorded in the previous quarter of 2022. The increase was mainly driven due to the rise in 
number of people declaring themselves to be looking for work.

6.5. Outlook 
Although the Spanish economy is forecast to grow by 4.4% in 2022, the country’s soaring levels of inflation, high 
unemployment levels along with high levels of government debt and increasing energy crisis continue to remain a 
cause of concern. According to MarketLine, the Spanish economy is forecast to experience a major slowdown and 
grow by 0.7% in 2023 mainly due to the heavy negative impact of the energy crisis along with lower consumer 
spending that weighs on the economy. In addition, if the Russia-Ukraine war continues to persist, the energy crisis 
would continue to worsen as there would be further increase in gas and power prices which would in turn impact 
the domestic economy in the coming months.

7. Social Landscape
7.1. Summary
Key social issues in Spain, such as an aging population and high unemployment, are similar to those experienced by 
many other European nations. The birth rate has been declining in recent years, and there are fewer people entering 
the workforce. The Spanish education system has undergone significant reforms, which has led to its above average 
performance in terms of tertiary education.
7.2. Evolution
Spain’s social landscape underwent significant changes after the abolition of the dictatorship and the adoption of a
democratic government. Spain’s post-civil war economic development transformed a conservative society into an 
advanced industrial society. By the 1980s, Spain had acquired most of the characteristics of European society, such 
as declining birth rates, the migration of rural workers to urban areas and the participation of women in the labor 
force. The government became more proactive in providing social security to its population, and social welfare 
measures increased during the late 1980s and the 1990s.
Spain's population is drawn from a diverse range of ethnic and linguistic groups. As this diversity gave rise to 
conflicts, the 1978 constitution provided for the establishment of regional autonomous governments with the 
powers and the resources necessary to protect their ethnicity and regional languages. The influence of the Roman 
Catholic Church, which at one time played a dominant role in Spanish life, has gradually diminished over the years as 
society has become more secular.
7.3. Structure and policies 
7.3.1. Demographic composition
Age and gender-wise composition
According to MarketLine estimates, as of 2022, the age structure showed that 65.8% of the population were in the 
15–64 age group, 14.1% of the population were in the 0–14 age group, and 20.1% of the population were aged 65 
years or above. With this age structure, Spain has a demographic trend like that seen across the rest of Europe. 
There has been an increase in the elderly population and fewer people are entering the workforce. The gender ratio 
in Spain was 96.1 males per 100 females as of 2022, according to MarketLine estimates.

7.3.3. Education
The current education system in Spain is based on the 1990 education law Ley Organica de Ordenacion General del 
Sistema Educativa, which translates as the Organic Law on the General Organization of the Educational System. This 
law restructured primary and secondary education, providing free and compulsory education from six to 16 years of 
age. School curriculums were also protracted to incorporate newer technical subjects and foreign languages.
The breakup of the stages of education for Spanish children includes preparatory education, primary education, 
compulsory secondary education, post-compulsory secondary education and tertiary education. 
Although basic education begins as early as three years of age, the first three years of education are not compulsory. 
They are, however, considered an integral part of the system, and are available in almost all primary schools.
Universities in Spain date back to the medieval ages and are based on the 19th century liberal and centralized French 
model but have been gradually moving toward a self-governed and decentralized model. Education in universities is 
not free, but university grants and scholarships are available for both residents and foreign students, and one in

every seven students receives a grant. Fees are lower for Spaniards and EU nationals, as is the cost of 
accommodation. US universities also operate in Spain with the same standard of teaching and learning. 
Schools are maintained by three types of management: public, private, and a combination of both called 
"concertado". A concertado school is maintained by a public administrative body but is subsidized by the 
government. The concertados usually combine both primary and secondary education.
7.3.4. Healthcare
Healthcare services
The current healthcare system came into existence during the transition to democracy. The central government is 
responsible for promoting coordination and cooperation among health units. The 1986 General Healthcare Act 
outlines the main principles of the National Health Service. From 1986, healthcare financing was changed, with the 
former insurance-oriented system transformed into a system financed by taxes, providing Spanish residents with 
almost universal coverage. The decentralization reform was completed in 2002, which resulted in governance of the 
system being decentralized to all 17 autonomous provinces. At a provincial level, the two main sources of finance are 
taxes and allocations from the central government. Private healthcare finance consists of out-of-pocket payments to 
the private sector and voluntary health insurance. The government has to focus more on improvements to
accessibility and spending on healthcare.
According to the OECD, the Spanish government’s per capita expenditure on healthcare stood at $3,718 in 2020,
which is lower than the per capita expenditure on healthcare in Germany ($7,179). Spain must improve the human 
resources available in the healthcare sector. According to MarketLine, in 2021, the total number of nurses available
stood at 297,327 compared to 1.0 million nurses in Germany the same year. 
7.3.5. Social welfare
Social welfare policies
The social welfare scenario in Spain has changed from a series of social security schemes to a whole range of social 
welfare bodies, industrial foundations, insurance societies, friendly societies, pension schemes, and funds. Social 
welfare policies started later in Spain than in most European countries. Until the late 1930s, the Catholic Church had 
a great deal of influence over welfare policies and often designed them in a way that favored the ruling autocratic 
family. When Franco came into power after the civil war of 1936, he discarded the existing system of welfare 
reforms and introduced new laws that were more people-oriented. 
The social security system improved after the country formed a democratic government. The PSOE came into power 
in the first democratic elections held in 1982. It brought about dramatic changes to the existing welfare system and 
planted the roots of reform. From a social standpoint, the new welfare system was more comprehensive than the 
previous one in the sense that it included healthcare, housing, and education, which were overlooked by the 
previous government. The Felipe Gonzalez-led administration was particularly mindful of the working class and
introduced earnings-related contributory benefits for employees. These benefits were designed to address issues 
such as post-retirement benefits, disability benefits, sickness benefits, and widowhood benefits. The government 
adopted the "pay as you go" pension system as a conduit to make these policies effective for the economically active 
population. The PSOE established healthcare reforms in 1986 in order to guarantee access and the right to 
healthcare for all Spaniards and foreigners in Spain, by making healthcare insurance available to everyone.
Housing has been of major concern for the Spanish government since the "Spanish Miracle" of 1960, when real 
estate prices reached dizzying heights. Under the Franco regime, prices dropped only marginally, making it difficult

for the lower classes to be able to afford housing. The Gonzalez government made home ownership more affordable 
through mortgage subsidies.
After the financial crisis that hit Spain in the early 1990s, unemployment became a key problem for the economy. As 
the number of people losing their jobs increased, those claiming unemployment benefits also rose, causing a strain 
on government finances. The funds available were inadequate to cover the insurance benefits of all claimants. Spain 
has a tenacious insurance system in place, and the benefits accrued by these plans are more remunerative than 
those in other EU nations. 
7.4. Performance 
7.4.1. Healthcare
According to MarketLine, the government healthcare expenditure was recorded at 7.3% of GDP in 2021. The 
government healthcare expenditure decreased to 6.9% of GDP in 2022, as per MarketLine estimates.

7.4.2. Education 
Spain had a literacy rate of 98.7% for the total adult population (15 years and above) as of 2021, according to 
MarketLine. While the male literacy rate was at 99.0%, the female literacy rate was slightly lower at 98.1%. 
Government expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP was 4.2% in 2022, according to MarketLine
estimates.

7.5. Outlook 
Under the budget for 2023, Spain emphasized additional spending on healthcare, education, tax changes, and 
combating rising unemployment. The aging population will continue to stretch public finances. However, with the 
government bringing in initiatives related to healthcare and the education sector, the country’s social landscape is 
set to improve in the coming years.

8. Technological Landscape
8.1. Summary
Spain has been slow to adopt technological advancements compared to other European Union (EU) countries, 
although policy measures have been undertaken in this area. Although it performs well in terms of knowledge 
creation, the innovation climate is not particularly productive. This situation has arisen because of the large role the 
public sector plays with regard to research and development (R&D). The private sector has limited participation in
enhancing R&D levels.
8.2. Evolution
Spain’s sudden boost in performance in the 1960s had more to do with the economy and political factors than the
country’s R&D and technological development. In the early years of industrialization, Spain was dependent on 
foreign technology; however, Spain's policymakers soon realized that this dependence was a drain on its resources 
and started working toward self-sufficiency. Following on from the rule of Franco, enterprising endeavors were 
undertaken by the government in order to modernize its industries. The University Reform Law was enacted in 1983, 
followed by other science laws and procedures in 1986, such as the Patent Law. Since then, a great deal of effort has 
gone into stimulating scientific and technological development. These efforts gathered momentum with the 
country's accession to the European Community. Spanish companies and scientific communities have been 
participating in European programs such as the Framework Program, EUREKA, and the European Space Agency. 
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, government policy focused on the "science-technology-industry system", and 
funding research was prioritized according to the needs of the economy and society. However, there was a lack of 
coordination and consistency in terms of the implementation of policies. A shift in technology policy occurred in 
1996, when the conservative People's Party government assumed office. Policy became pro-business and the 
government moved to a more innovation-centered approach. In 2000, a new Ministry of Science and Technology 
was created and was made responsible for the development and application of science and technology. Spain plans 
to invest EUR15 billion ($16.5 billion) it received from the European coronavirus rescue plan. The country plans to 
boost its digital transformation. The aim is to develop a faster 5G network and extend coverage to rural areas in 
order to facilitate digital education for the population. Moreover, the government plans to invest a total of EUR70
billion ($77.1 billion) into digital transformation during 2020–22. In 2021, the Spanish government set out its R&D 
spending plan for 2021–25. The government aims to invest EUR456 million ($554.8 million) in the R&D spending 
plan.
In September 2021, the new Universilation of Digital Infrastructures for Cohesion Programme (UNICO), launched by 
the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation, expects telecom operators to provide 100 Mbps to 
100% of the population by 2025. According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation, an 
investment of EUR4.0 billion ($4.9 billion) is set to provide extended connectivity, deployment of 5G networks, and 
boost the cybersecurity ecosystem. In September 2021, Microsoft chose Spain as the base of its new research and 
development hub specialized in applying artificial intelligence technology in order to improve the user experience on 
the web.

8.3. Structure and policies 
The Spanish regulatory framework is decentralized; it allows regional governments to develop their own innovation 
and entrepreneurship policy. Each autonomous community has created its own regional development agency, the 
main activities of which include the establishment of science and technology parks and technology transfer 
organizations, as well as the initiation of university-enterprise interfaces. 
One of the most important policy changes was the Spanish Innovation Strategy 2013–20, as part of the ERA 2020 
Vision. It calls for increased cooperation between the public and private sectors, as well as reaffirming existing 
measures, giving more importance to risk capital funding, and introducing a public procurement policy for the first 
time based solely on innovation. In May 2011, the Spanish government approved a law on science, technology, and 
innovation to replace the existing Law of Scientific and Technological Research of 1986. The law mainly aims “to 
establish a general framework within which to strengthen and coordinate scientific and technical research in order 
to contribute to sustainable development and social welfare by generating and sharing knowledge and innovation”. 
The main agencies involved in the development and implementation of strategy, technology and innovation policies 
are the Ministry of Education and Science and the Ministry of Industry. The Interministerial Commission on Science 
and Technology coordinates the R&D activities of different ministries and plays a key role in the Spanish National 
R&D and Innovation plan. The Spanish National Plan for Scientific Research, Development, and Technological 
Innovation covers a broad range of scientific areas and develops policies for innovative practices by supporting 
technological innovation and R&D excellence. The national R&D plan is the embodiment of various technological 
development plans, including strategic R&D programs and general funding mechanisms for non-oriented and nonprioritized research activities.
8.3.1. Intellectual property
Spain has well-developed intellectual property rights (IPR) legislation, which is similar to the system followed in other 
EU nations. Spain ratified the 1973 Munich European Patent Convention, which made the country a designated 
nation for European patent applications. The IPR law provides for both product and process patents. A nonrenewable 20-year period for working patents is granted. Spain is also a signatory to the Universal Copyright 
Convention, which protects all literary, artistic, and scientific creations (including computer software). The Spanish 
office of patents and trademarks is responsible for the protection of trademarks, which, once registered, receive 
protection for 10 years and can be renewed. According to US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), 1,126 patents 
were issued for Spanish residents in 2021, compared to 1,187 patents in 2020. Spain’s performance is poor 
compared to the 17,971 patents granted to people in Germany in 2021.
8.4. Performance 
8.4.1. Mobile and internet
According to MarketLine estimates, mobile penetration stood at 120.2 per 100 people in 2022, with total subscribers 
at 57.4 million. Internet users, as of 2022 stood, at 45.4 million, with a penetration rate of 95.0% the same year.

8.5. Outlook 
The government has initiated measures to address the shortfall in the innovation system by revamping the 
education system and introducing new technology. The lack of innovation and entrepreneurship in the system has 
emerged because a low percentage of small and medium-sized enterprises are involved in innovation, and because 
of the low participation of the private sector and venture capitalists. The low level of innovation in Spain is reflected 
by the low number of patents registered. The country only registered 1,126 patents in 2021, compared to Germany 
which registered 17,971 patents. Although the number of patents is on the rise, the figure is still significantly behind 
the levels seen in other leading nations. Any continuation of this trend is expected to hamper the country’s scientific 
prospects. A positive environment could be created by enhancing incentives and making the venture capitalist 
funding procedure simpler. The government’s decision to promote early-stage investment rather than focusing on 
expansion is a step in the right direction and should show positive results in the long-term. Furthermore, the new 
policy on tax incentives for R&D enterprises will also boost efforts in this direction.

9. Legal Landscape
9.1. Summary
The Spanish legal system owes its origins to the constitution of 1978. The country has an independent judiciary, free 
from other branches of government. There are four categories of courts: civil, criminal, administrative, and social. 
The federal system of governance is also reflected in the judicial structure. For jurisdictional purposes, the Spanish 
territory is divided into municipalities, judicial districts, provinces, and autonomous communities. The autonomous 
communities have wide-ranging legislative and executive powers.
After assuming EU membership, the Spanish government initiated legal reforms to ensure greater integration. Tax 
rates have been reduced, investment regulations have been eased out, and hitherto restricted sectors are being 
opened up to encourage private investment. Nevertheless, government interference in economic matters still exists, 
which can make economic decision-making somewhat rigid. 
9.2. Evolution 
The Spanish judiciary system owes its origins to the constitution, which came into effect in 1978. As per the 
constitution, justice emanates from the people and is administered in the name of the king by independent judges. 
The constitution made the judiciary independent of the executive and legislative branches of government. The 
judicial system is based on civil law and is governed by precise codes. 
As a member of the EU, Spain's constitution allows for the exercise of constitutional powers by international 
organizations and the restriction of national sovereignty under several conditions. In this way, Spanish law has been 
greatly influenced by EU legislation. The regulations of the European Council have played an important role in 
shaping the nation’s laws. A number of amendments have been passed to ensure the harmonization of laws across 
all the EU member states.
9.3. Structure and policies 
9.3.1. Judicial system
Structure of the system
The Supreme Court is the highest body in the judicial pyramid, with authority over all legal issues except 
constitutional questions. The judicial system is controlled by the Consejo General del Poder Judicial (CGPJ), which 
translates as the General Council of the Judiciary. The CGPJ is an independent government body responsible for the 
power of the judiciary, and it has jurisdiction over the whole country. The members are proposed by Congress and 
the Senate. 
Given the federal structure of the country, the judiciary is hierarchical in nature, based on territorial divisions. For 
jurisdictional purposes, the country is divided into municipalities, judicial districts, provinces, and autonomous 
Legal Landscape

communities. There is a system of appeals against the decisions of lower courts to higher courts, and finally to the 
Supreme Court. Only the Supreme Court and the National Court have jurisdiction over all the territories of Spain. 
According to the subjects for decision, Spanish courts are organized into four categories: civil (for civil or commercial 
issues), criminal (for violations of the criminal code), social (for social security and employment contracts issues), and 
administrative (for claims based on acts performed by public administration). 
Corporate income tax
Corporate income tax applies to entities that are tax residents in Spain. Any company registered in Spain is taxed on 
its worldwide income. An entity is considered a resident in Spain for tax purposes if it has been formed in accordance 
with the laws of Spain, or if it has its registered office or its effective place of management in the country. The 
combined corporate income tax rate (central government corporate income tax plus sub-central corporate income 
tax) is 25% as of 2022. 
Income tax
Individual residents in Spain have to pay personal income tax. The country follows a system of progressive taxation 
with rates that start at 19% and can go up to a tax rate of 26%, as of 2022.
9.3.2. Corporate governance
Spain has made considerable progress with regard to developing corporate governance for its companies. A number 
of companies have been successful in adopting best governance practices from different systems, especially the 
Anglo-Saxon codes. In 2003, Spanish firms created a code of business practices and ethics, which was codified by 
Spanish regulatory agencies in 2004. Spain’s listed companies are required to comply with such codes and 
transparency rules.
9.4. Performance
9.4.1. Effectiveness of the legal system
A significant number of commercial laws and regulations were modernized in 1986 after the country attained EU 
membership, and the country's local regulatory framework compares well with other EU nations. Government 
intervention in economic matters has not stopped altogether, but bureaucratic procedures have been streamlined 
by the elimination of red tape. However, the legislation and implementation of business regulations is not uniform 
across the nation due to regional autonomy. According to the World Bank, Doing Business (2020) report, Spain 
ranked 30th out of 190 countries. In terms of resolving insolvency, the country ranked 18th out of 190 countries and 
country was ranked 26th for enforcing contracts. 
9.5. Outlook 
Spain’s regulatory reform measures began in the post-liberalization period. Economic reform programs were coupled 
with legislative changes to meet the challenges arising from the new economic landscape. Nevertheless, starting a 
business takes longer than the OECD average. According to the World Bank, Doing Business Report (2020), it takes 
12.5 days to start a business in Spain, compared to the OECD high income average of 9.2 days. It takes seven

procedures to start a business in Spain, while the OECD high income average is 4.9. However, the country improved 
its ranking in terms of starting a business by streamlining the procedures required to start a business, which is a step 
in the right direction. It has also eased the procedure of paying taxes and has taken effective steps to protect 
minority investors. The government’s move to free up professional services and curb tax evasion are welcome for a 
country in deficit. The regulatory regime is expected to see further reforms, which are expected to improve the
country’s investment landscape.

10. Environmental Landscape
10.1. Summary
In the policymaking process, the significance of the environment emerged after Spain became a member of the EU. 
The associated legislative process gained momentum after the formation of the Ministry of Environment in 1996. 
Spain has participated in important environmental agreements and is committed to meeting its obligations. The 
country has increased its international commitments to help improve the climatic conditions of underdeveloped 
nations, particularly in Latin America. 
Both national and regional governments are responsible for the legislation and implementation of environmental 
directives. However, despite the continued efforts of successive governments, coupled with increased participation 
from the private sector, the country has achieved only partial success in terms of improving its environmental 
conditions. In 2018, Spain announced an environmental policy where the country would end its dependance on fossil 
fuel. Additionally, the country also announced that it would generate 75% of its electricity from renewable sources, 
with an aim to generate 100% electricity from renewable sources by 2050 and decarbonize the economy thereafter.
Moreover, Spain plans to ban the sale of fossil fuel vehicles by 2040. The country also aims to reduce its greenhouse 
gas emissions by at least 23%, compared to 1990 levels, by 2030.
10.2. Evolution 
The environmental agenda had a delayed entry into the Spanish policymaking process. The topic only truly received 
domestic attention after Spain became a member of the EU. After joining the EU, the government was expected to 
adhere to a number of EU directives with regards to the environment. More often than not, the Spanish approach 
has been reactive rather than proactive. Following the creation of the Ministry of Environment in 1996, the concept 
of sustainability became part of the government's agenda. Since the 1990s, the government has been active in 
meeting international commitments to safeguard the environment. 
10.3. Structure and policies 
10.3.1. Environmental regulations
Overview 
In Spain, the central government is responsible for the coordination and promotion of environmental policies, as well 
as issuing basic environmental guidelines with regard to the management of public water resources, transport, and 
energy. The autonomous communities are responsible for the implementation and monitoring of environmental 
policies, and are also authorized to issue additional, more restrictive laws on the exploitation of natural resources 
within their provinces. In addition, they are responsible for managing and implementing policies in matters that have 
a local impact. 
The Spanish Climate Change Office is responsible for developing the national climate change policy. There are other 
bodies, such as the General Direction of Nature Conservation and the General Sub-direction of Woods, which are 
Environmental Landscape
PESTLE Country Analysis Report: Spain ML00002-021/Published 01/2023

responsible for the evaluation and control of the forest sector. These bodies are also responsible for coordination 
with the autonomous communities and various academic and environmental institutions, as well as for the collection 
of environmental data and observation of the climate.
Policy
In order to protect the environment from different pollutants, the Spanish government has passed many laws and 
decrees. The first ever law to curb the emission of greenhouse gases was passed by the Aznar administration in 
2004. Following suit, the current government is in the process of creating a strategy for sustainable development and 
climate change to be implemented by every ministry and province. The most pressing environmental issues that 
need to be addressed by the Spanish government are greenhouse gas emissions, water management, biodiversity 
conservation, climate change, air pollution, sustainable tourism, and the management of waste disposal. 
The Air Pollution Plan is Spain’s first serious attempt at maintaining its air pollution levels under the targets 
stipulated by the Kyoto Protocol. Under this plan, all industrial and energy production plants – which are known to 
emit the highest amount of CO2 – will be assigned a CO2/other greenhouse gases limit. 
Other national laws include a law on packaging waste introduced in 1997, an environmental impact assessment 
introduced in 2001, an integrated pollution prevention and control law introduced in 2002, and a regulation offering 
protection for forests was introduced in 2003. The autonomous communities have also legislated their legal 
frameworks. The legislation on biodiversity protection has been modified to meet the requirements of both the EU 
and the United Nations (UN).
Both national and regional governments have been functioning as per EU directives. These bodies are focusing on 
environmental infrastructure investment and financing. The national government has managed to increase 
enforcement activities at all levels. For instance, it developed product charges on packaging waste and introduced 
landfill taxes on municipal waste. The government rolled out a national renewable energy plan for 2011–20, which 
consisted of a range of financial and regulatory measures designed to increase dependency on renewable energy. 
However, the government’s move in 2014 to drill for oil off the coast of Spain in the Atlantic was criticized by 
environmentalists. The COP21 agreement in Paris was ratified by the Spanish government in 2015.
According to the parliamentary draft plan, Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan 2021–30, 74% of Spain’s 
total electricity supply is expected to come from renewable sources. The bill plans for an investment of EUR237
billion ($263.3 billion) during 2021 to 2030, which is expected to create 300,000 jobs. According to Spain’s National 
Energy and Climate Plan, the country aims to have 5 million electric vehicles on the roads by 2030, including cars, 
vans, motorcycles, and buses. 
In July 2021, President Pedro Sánchez presented the Recovery and Economic Transformation (PERTE) project, which 
is based on public-private partnership, with a focus on strengthening the value chains of the automotive industry in 
Spain. The PERTE project expects an investment of EUR24 billion ($29.2 billion) over 2021–23. The public sector’s
contribution is expected to be EUR4.3 billion ($5.2 billion) and the private sector’s investment is expected to be 
EUR19.7 billion ($24.0 billion). With the investment, the government aims to increase electric vehicles’ share of GDP 
by 15% by 2030. The main purpose of the project is to create an environment which would help develop and 
manufacture electric and grid-connected vehicles, thereby turning Spain into the European hub for electromobility.
In addition, with the implementation of PERTE, 140,000 jobs are expected to be created over 2021–23. Under PERTE, 
the government expects the register 250,000 electric vehicles by 2023.

According to BP, BP Statistical Review of World Energy (2022), CO2 emissions declined to 245.7 million tonnes in 
2021 from 306.3 million tonnes in 2012. According to Yale University, Environmental Performance Index (EPI) (2022), 
which ranks countries based on their performance on various indicators. In the 2022 EPI, Spain ranked 27th out of 
180 nations on the overall environmental performance index. In addition, out of 180 countries, the country ranked 
57th on the species habitat index, 25th on the species protection index, and 20th on the solid waste management 
index.

10.5. Outlook 
The government’s move towards dependency on renewable energy by 2050 is a welcome change. The Spanish 
government needs to take proactive measures to decrease the emission of greenhouse gases, otherwise it will face 
negative economic consequences in the long run. The scrapping of the oil exploration project in the Canary Islands 
by Repsol has been well received by environmentalists. In February 2019, the Spanish government announced a 
public investment plan worth EUR47 billion ($53 billion) to address climate change. This fund will be partially raised 
by issuing green bonds. Spain plans to cut net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050.
